CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole
S2: line = 40, bytes = 31, words = 6
S3: line = 40, score = 0.259
---
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
S2: line = 42, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 42, score = 0.000
---
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
S2: line = 43, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 43, score = 0.000
---
book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
S2: line = 44, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 44, score = 0.000
---
it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or
S2: line = 45, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 45, score = 0.000
---
conversations?'
S2: line = 46, bytes = 15, words = 1
S3: line = 46, score = 0.000
---
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
S2: line = 48, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 48, score = 0.220
---
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
S2: line = 49, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 49, score = 0.229
---
of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
S2: line = 50, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 50, score = 0.000
---
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
S2: line = 51, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 51, score = 0.000
---
close by her.
S2: line = 52, bytes = 13, words = 3
S3: line = 52, score = 0.000
---
There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
S2: line = 54, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 54, score = 0.000
---
VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!
S2: line = 55, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 55, score = 0.220
---
Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it
S2: line = 56, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 56, score = 0.000
---
occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
S2: line = 57, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 57, score = 0.000
---
it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH
S2: line = 58, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 58, score = 0.000
---
OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
S2: line = 59, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 59, score = 0.000
---
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
S2: line = 60, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 60, score = 0.445
---
never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch
S2: line = 61, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 61, score = 0.000
---
to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
S2: line = 62, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 62, score = 0.223
---
after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
S2: line = 63, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 63, score = 0.439
---
rabbit-hole under the hedge.
S2: line = 64, bytes = 28, words = 5
S3: line = 64, score = 0.000
---
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
S2: line = 66, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 66, score = 0.229
---
in the world she was to get out again.
S2: line = 67, bytes = 38, words = 9
S3: line = 67, score = 0.000
---
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
S2: line = 69, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 69, score = 0.445
---
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
S2: line = 70, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 70, score = 0.226
---
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
S2: line = 71, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 71, score = 0.593
---
well.
S2: line = 72, bytes = 5, words = 1
S3: line = 72, score = 0.000
---
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
S2: line = 74, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 74, score = 0.353
---
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was
S2: line = 75, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 75, score = 0.217
---
going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what
S2: line = 76, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 76, score = 0.445
---
she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
S2: line = 77, bytes = 64, words = 14
S3: line = 77, score = 0.000
---
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
S2: line = 78, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 78, score = 0.223
---
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
S2: line = 79, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 79, score = 0.000
---
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as
S2: line = 80, bytes = 62, words = 14
S3: line = 80, score = 0.445
---
she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great
S2: line = 81, bytes = 64, words = 11
S3: line = 81, score = 0.000
---
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
S2: line = 82, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 82, score = 0.353
---
of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
S2: line = 83, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 83, score = 0.000
---
she fell past it.
S2: line = 84, bytes = 17, words = 4
S3: line = 84, score = 0.274
---
'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall
S2: line = 86, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 86, score = 0.226
---
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at
S2: line = 87, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 87, score = 0.223
---
home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top
S2: line = 88, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 88, score = 0.217
---
of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)
S2: line = 89, bytes = 44, words = 8
S3: line = 89, score = 0.000
---
Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how
S2: line = 91, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 91, score = 0.668
---
many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting
S2: line = 92, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 92, score = 0.220
---
somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
S2: line = 93, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 93, score = 0.223
---
thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several
S2: line = 94, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 94, score = 0.459
---
things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
S2: line = 95, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 95, score = 0.000
---
was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there
S2: line = 96, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 96, score = 0.226
---
was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)
S2: line = 97, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 97, score = 0.000
---
'--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude
S2: line = 98, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 98, score = 0.000
---
or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or
S2: line = 99, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 99, score = 0.223
---
Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
S2: line = 100, bytes = 65, words = 11
S3: line = 100, score = 0.233
---
Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the
S2: line = 102, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 102, score = 0.226
---
earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with
S2: line = 103, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 103, score = 0.220
---
their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad
S2: line = 104, bytes = 70, words = 11
S3: line = 104, score = 0.233
---
there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the
S2: line = 105, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 105, score = 0.000
---
right word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country
S2: line = 106, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 106, score = 0.000
---
is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and
S2: line = 107, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 107, score = 0.000
---
she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling
S2: line = 108, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 108, score = 0.358
---
through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an
S2: line = 109, bytes = 64, words = 13
S3: line = 109, score = 0.000
---
ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to
S2: line = 110, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 110, score = 0.220
---
ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'
S2: line = 111, bytes = 50, words = 9
S3: line = 111, score = 0.000
---
Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
S2: line = 113, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 113, score = 0.452
---
talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'
S2: line = 114, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 114, score = 0.000
---
(Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at
S2: line = 115, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 115, score = 0.000
---
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no
S2: line = 116, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 116, score = 0.217
---
mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very
S2: line = 117, bytes = 71, words = 17
S3: line = 117, score = 0.000
---
like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice
S2: line = 118, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 118, score = 0.000
---
began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy
S2: line = 119, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 119, score = 0.000
---
sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do
S2: line = 120, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 120, score = 0.223
---
bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,
S2: line = 121, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 121, score = 0.226
---
it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing
S2: line = 122, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 122, score = 0.433
---
off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with
S2: line = 123, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 123, score = 0.000
---
Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:
S2: line = 124, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 124, score = 0.000
---
did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon
S2: line = 125, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 125, score = 0.223
---
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
S2: line = 126, bytes = 55, words = 12
S3: line = 126, score = 0.229
---
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
S2: line = 128, bytes = 71, words = 17
S3: line = 128, score = 0.214
---
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
S2: line = 129, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 129, score = 0.000
---
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
S2: line = 130, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 130, score = 0.452
---
There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and
S2: line = 131, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 131, score = 0.000
---
was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears
S2: line = 132, bytes = 67, words = 16
S3: line = 132, score = 0.000
---
and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she
S2: line = 133, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 133, score = 0.000
---
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
S2: line = 134, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 134, score = 0.445
---
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
S2: line = 135, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 135, score = 0.217
---
from the roof.
S2: line = 136, bytes = 14, words = 3
S3: line = 136, score = 0.284
---
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
S2: line = 138, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 138, score = 0.000
---
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
S2: line = 139, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 139, score = 0.439
---
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
S2: line = 140, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 140, score = 0.226
---
get out again.
S2: line = 141, bytes = 14, words = 3
S3: line = 141, score = 0.000
---
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
S2: line = 143, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 143, score = 0.000
---
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's
S2: line = 144, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 144, score = 0.000
---
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
S2: line = 145, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 145, score = 0.220
---
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
S2: line = 146, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 146, score = 0.000
---
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
S2: line = 147, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 147, score = 0.000
---
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
S2: line = 148, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 148, score = 0.000
---
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
S2: line = 149, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 149, score = 0.226
---
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
S2: line = 150, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 150, score = 0.226
---
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
S2: line = 152, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 152, score = 0.223
---
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage
S2: line = 153, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 153, score = 0.223
---
into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of
S2: line = 154, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 154, score = 0.223
---
that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and
S2: line = 155, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 155, score = 0.226
---
those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the
S2: line = 156, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 156, score = 0.226
---
doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it
S2: line = 157, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 157, score = 0.000
---
would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could
S2: line = 158, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 158, score = 0.000
---
shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.'
S2: line = 159, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 159, score = 0.000
---
For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,
S2: line = 160, bytes = 64, words = 13
S3: line = 160, score = 0.452
---
that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
S2: line = 161, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 161, score = 0.226
---
impossible.
S2: line = 162, bytes = 11, words = 1
S3: line = 162, score = 0.000
---
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
S2: line = 164, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 164, score = 0.000
---
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
S2: line = 165, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 165, score = 0.220
---
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
S2: line = 166, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 166, score = 0.226
---
time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here
S2: line = 167, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 167, score = 0.226
---
before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
S2: line = 168, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 168, score = 0.000
---
label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large
S2: line = 169, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 169, score = 0.000
---
letters.
S2: line = 170, bytes = 8, words = 1
S3: line = 170, score = 0.000
---
It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was
S2: line = 172, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 172, score = 0.000
---
not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and

S3: line = 173, score = 0.217

---
beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember
S2: line = 176, bytes = 71, words = 11
S3: line = 176, score = 0.000
---
the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot
S2: line = 177, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 177, score = 0.223
---
poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your

S3: line = 178, score = 0.217
---
finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never
S2: line = 179, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 179, score = 0.226
---
forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is
S2: line = 180, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 180, score = 0.358
---
almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
S2: line = 181, bytes = 53, words = 9
S3: line = 181, score = 0.000
---
However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste
S2: line = 183, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 183, score = 0.000
---
it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour
S2: line = 184, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 184, score = 0.439

'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a
S2: line = 194, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 194, score = 0.226
---
telescope.'
S2: line = 195, bytes = 11, words = 1
S3: line = 195, score = 0.000

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
S2: line = 197, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 197, score = 0.220
---
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
S2: line = 198, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 198, score = 0.223
---
through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
S2: line = 199, bytes = 68, words = 11
S3: line = 199, score = 0.233
---
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
S2: line = 200, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 200, score = 0.439
---
she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said
S2: line = 201, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 201, score = 0.353
---
Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder
S2: line = 202, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 202, score = 0.000
---
what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a
S2: line = 203, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 203, score = 0.343
---
candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember
S2: line = 204, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 204, score = 0.223
---
ever having seen such a thing.
S2: line = 205, bytes = 30, words = 6
S3: line = 205, score = 0.000
---
After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
S2: line = 207, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 207, score = 0.229
---
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
S2: line = 208, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 208, score = 0.220
---
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
S2: line = 209, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 209, score = 0.358
---
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
S2: line = 210, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 210, score = 0.353
---
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
S2: line = 211, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 211, score = 0.000
---
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
S2: line = 212, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 212, score = 0.000
---
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
S2: line = 213, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 213, score = 0.000
---
sat down and cried.
S2: line = 214, bytes = 19, words = 4
S3: line = 214, score = 0.274
---
'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself,
S2: line = 216, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 216, score = 0.000
---
rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally
S2: line = 217, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 217, score = 0.000
---
gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
S2: line = 218, bytes = 68, words = 11
S3: line = 218, score = 0.233
---
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
S2: line = 219, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 219, score = 0.000
---
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
S2: line = 220, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 220, score = 0.223
---
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
S2: line = 221, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 221, score = 0.000
---
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
S2: line = 222, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 222, score = 0.358
---
'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!
S2: line = 223, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 223, score = 0.000
---
Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'
S2: line = 224, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 224, score = 0.000
---
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
S2: line = 226, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 226, score = 0.220
---
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
S2: line = 227, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 227, score = 0.220
---
'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said
S2: line = 228, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 228, score = 0.000
---
Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
S2: line = 229, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 229, score = 0.000
---
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll
S2: line = 230, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 230, score = 0.220
---
get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'
S2: line = 231, bytes = 53, words = 11
S3: line = 231, score = 0.000
---
She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which
S2: line = 233, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 233, score = 0.226
---
way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
S2: line = 234, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 234, score = 0.560
---
growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
S2: line = 235, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 235, score = 0.226
---
size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
S2: line = 236, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 236, score = 0.000
---
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
S2: line = 237, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 237, score = 0.348
---
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on
S2: line = 238, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 238, score = 0.220
---
in the common way.
S2: line = 239, bytes = 18, words = 4
S3: line = 239, score = 0.274
---
So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

S3: line = 241, score = 0.229

'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
S2: line = 254, bytes = 71, words = 11
S3: line = 254, score = 0.000
---
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm
S2: line = 255, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 255, score = 0.353
---
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!'
S2: line = 256, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 256, score = 0.229
---
(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
S2: line = 257, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 257, score = 0.568
---
sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder
S2: line = 258, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 258, score = 0.353

who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure
S2: line = 259, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 259, score = 0.220

_I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble

S3: line = 260, score = 0.217

myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be

S3: line = 261, score = 0.220

kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want
S2: line = 262, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 262, score = 0.220

to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'
S2: line = 263, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 263, score = 0.000

And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 'They must

S3: line = 265, score = 0.000
---
go by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending

         NEAR THE FENDER,
S2: line = 271, bytes = 25, words = 3

           (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).

Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'
S2: line = 274, bytes = 36, words = 7
S3: line = 274, score = 0.000

Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
S2: line = 276, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 276, score = 0.220
---
now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
S2: line = 277, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 277, score = 0.220
---
key and hurried off to the garden door.
S2: line = 278, bytes = 39, words = 8
S3: line = 278, score = 0.000
---
Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
S2: line = 280, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 280, score = 0.217
---
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
S2: line = 281, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 281, score = 0.000
---
hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
S2: line = 282, bytes = 56, words = 11
S3: line = 282, score = 0.233
---
'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like

S3: line = 284, score = 0.000
---
you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way! Stop this
S2: line = 285, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 285, score = 0.220
---
moment, I tell you!' But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
S2: line = 286, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 286, score = 0.000
---
tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches
S2: line = 287, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 287, score = 0.226
---
deep and reaching half down the hall.
S2: line = 288, bytes = 37, words = 7
S3: line = 288, score = 0.253
---
After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
S2: line = 290, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 290, score = 0.223
---
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
S2: line = 291, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 291, score = 0.000
---
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in
S2: line = 292, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 292, score = 0.000
---
one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great
S2: line = 293, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 293, score = 0.217
---
hurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess!
S2: line = 294, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 294, score = 0.000
---
Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so
S2: line = 295, bytes = 64, words = 15
S3: line = 295, score = 0.220
---
desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit
S2: line = 296, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 296, score = 0.000
---
came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--'
S2: line = 297, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 297, score = 0.000
---
The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,
S2: line = 298, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 298, score = 0.229
---
and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
S2: line = 299, bytes = 59, words = 12
S3: line = 299, score = 0.000
---
Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
S2: line = 301, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 301, score = 0.220
---
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How
S2: line = 302, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 302, score = 0.226
---
queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
S2: line = 303, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 303, score = 0.000

I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the

---
same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a
S2: line = 305, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 305, score = 0.220
---
little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who
S2: line = 306, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 306, score = 0.000
---
in the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began thinking
S2: line = 307, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 307, score = 0.000
---
over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to
S2: line = 308, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 308, score = 0.000

see if she could have been changed for any of them.

S3: line = 309, score = 0.233

'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long

S3: line = 313, score = 0.217

very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzling
S2: line = 314, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 314, score = 0.000

it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me
S2: line = 315, bytes = 67, words = 18
S3: line = 315, score = 0.000

see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and
S2: line = 316, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 316, score = 0.452

four times seven is--oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!

However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.

S3: line = 318, score = 0.000

London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and

Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for

S3: line = 320, score = 0.220

Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"' and she crossed her
S2: line = 321, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 321, score = 0.000
---
hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,
S2: line = 322, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 322, score = 0.000

but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the

'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes
S2: line = 336, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 336, score = 0.000
---
filled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and
S2: line = 337, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 337, score = 0.220
---
I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to

S3: line = 338, score = 0.000
---
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've
S2: line = 339, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 339, score = 0.000
---
made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no
S2: line = 340, bytes = 72, words = 19
S3: line = 340, score = 0.209

use their putting their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I
S2: line = 341, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 341, score = 0.226

shall only look up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then,
S2: line = 342, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 342, score = 0.217
---
if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here
S2: line = 343, bytes = 70, words = 17
S3: line = 343, score = 0.214
---
till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst
S2: line = 344, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 344, score = 0.000
---
of tears, 'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired
S2: line = 345, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 345, score = 0.217
---
of being all alone here!'
S2: line = 346, bytes = 25, words = 5
S3: line = 346, score = 0.000
---
As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
S2: line = 348, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 348, score = 0.220
---
that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while
S2: line = 349, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 349, score = 0.000
---
she was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I must
S2: line = 350, bytes = 65, words = 13
S3: line = 350, score = 0.000
---
be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure
S2: line = 351, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 351, score = 0.000
---
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now
S2: line = 352, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 352, score = 0.220
---
about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found
S2: line = 353, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 353, score = 0.358
---
out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped
S2: line = 354, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 354, score = 0.220
---
it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
S2: line = 355, bytes = 60, words = 10
S3: line = 355, score = 0.000
---
'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
S2: line = 357, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 357, score = 0.226
---
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and
S2: line = 358, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 358, score = 0.229
---
now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door:
S2: line = 359, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 359, score = 0.220
---
but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was
S2: line = 360, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 360, score = 0.000
---
lying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,'
S2: line = 361, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 361, score = 0.000
---
thought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never!
S2: line = 362, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 362, score = 0.223
---
And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'
S2: line = 363, bytes = 40, words = 10
S3: line = 363, score = 0.000
---
As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!
S2: line = 365, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 365, score = 0.226
---
she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she
S2: line = 366, bytes = 65, words = 15
S3: line = 366, score = 0.220
---
had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by
S2: line = 367, bytes = 67, words = 15
S3: line = 367, score = 0.220
---
railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
S2: line = 368, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 368, score = 0.000
---
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
S2: line = 369, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 369, score = 0.000
---
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
S2: line = 370, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 370, score = 0.223
---
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
S2: line = 371, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 371, score = 0.000
---
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon
S2: line = 372, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 372, score = 0.000
---
made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she
S2: line = 373, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 373, score = 0.000
---
was nine feet high.
S2: line = 374, bytes = 19, words = 4
S3: line = 374, score = 0.274
---
'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying
S2: line = 376, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 376, score = 0.000
---
to find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
S2: line = 377, bytes = 67, words = 15
S3: line = 377, score = 0.568
---
being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!
S2: line = 378, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 378, score = 0.000
---
However, everything is queer to-day.'
S2: line = 379, bytes = 37, words = 6
S3: line = 379, score = 0.000
---
Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
S2: line = 381, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 381, score = 0.226
---
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
S2: line = 382, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 382, score = 0.220
---
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
S2: line = 383, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 383, score = 0.000
---
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
S2: line = 384, bytes = 68, words = 16
S3: line = 384, score = 0.000
---
slipped in like herself.
S2: line = 385, bytes = 24, words = 4
S3: line = 385, score = 0.000
---
'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?
S2: line = 387, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 387, score = 0.000
---
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
S2: line = 388, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 388, score = 0.445
---
likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she
S2: line = 389, bytes = 67, words = 15
S3: line = 389, score = 0.000
---
began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
S2: line = 390, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 390, score = 0.217
---
of swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right
S2: line = 391, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 391, score = 0.000
---
way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
S2: line = 392, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 392, score = 0.220
---
she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of
S2: line = 393, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 393, score = 0.000
---
a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather
S2: line = 394, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 394, score = 0.000
---
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
S2: line = 395, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 395, score = 0.000
---
but it said nothing.
S2: line = 396, bytes = 20, words = 4
S3: line = 396, score = 0.000
---
'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's
S2: line = 398, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 398, score = 0.000
---
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all
S2: line = 399, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 399, score = 0.364
---
her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
S2: line = 400, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 400, score = 0.226
---
anything had happened.) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which
S2: line = 401, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 401, score = 0.000
---
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
S2: line = 402, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 402, score = 0.358
---
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
S2: line = 403, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 403, score = 0.223
---
'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt
S2: line = 404, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 404, score = 0.000
---
the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'
S2: line = 405, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 405, score = 0.358
---
'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would
S2: line = 407, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 407, score = 0.000
---
YOU like cats if you were me?'
S2: line = 408, bytes = 30, words = 7
S3: line = 408, score = 0.000
---
'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry
S2: line = 410, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 410, score = 0.000
---
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd
S2: line = 411, bytes = 70, words = 17
S3: line = 411, score = 0.000
---
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet
S2: line = 412, bytes = 72, words = 17
S3: line = 412, score = 0.214
---
thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
S2: line = 413, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 413, score = 0.000
---
pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and
S2: line = 414, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 414, score = 0.223
---
washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's
S2: line = 415, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 415, score = 0.217
---
such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried
S2: line = 416, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 416, score = 0.226
---
Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she
S2: line = 417, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 417, score = 0.226
---
felt certain it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her any
S2: line = 418, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 418, score = 0.223
---
more if you'd rather not.'
S2: line = 419, bytes = 26, words = 6
S3: line = 419, score = 0.000
---
'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
S2: line = 421, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 421, score = 0.223
---
tail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED
S2: line = 422, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 422, score = 0.223
---
cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'
S2: line = 423, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 423, score = 0.000
---
'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
S2: line = 425, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 425, score = 0.000
---
conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not
S2: line = 426, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 426, score = 0.226
---
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near
S2: line = 427, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 427, score = 0.000
---
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
S2: line = 428, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 428, score = 0.000
---
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when
S2: line = 429, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 429, score = 0.445
---
you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
S2: line = 430, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 430, score = 0.217
---
of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,
S2: line = 431, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 431, score = 0.220
---
you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He
S2: line = 432, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 432, score = 0.000
---
says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful
S2: line = 433, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 433, score = 0.000
---
tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming
S2: line = 434, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 434, score = 0.223
---
away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in
S2: line = 435, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 435, score = 0.220
---
the pool as it went.
S2: line = 436, bytes = 20, words = 5
S3: line = 436, score = 0.000
---
So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
S2: line = 438, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 438, score = 0.000
---
won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When the
S2: line = 439, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 439, score = 0.000
---
Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its
S2: line = 440, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 440, score = 0.000
---
face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
S2: line = 441, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 441, score = 0.223
---
trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
S2: line = 442, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 442, score = 0.000
---
history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'
S2: line = 443, bytes = 63, words = 13
S3: line = 443, score = 0.000
---
It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
S2: line = 445, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 445, score = 0.220
---
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,
S2: line = 446, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 446, score = 0.220
---
a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the
S2: line = 447, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 447, score = 0.000
---
way, and the whole party swam to the shore.
S2: line = 448, bytes = 43, words = 9
S3: line = 448, score = 0.242

CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
S2: line = 453, bytes = 42, words = 9
S3: line = 453, score = 0.242
---
They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the
S2: line = 455, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 455, score = 0.000
---
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
S2: line = 456, bytes = 71, words = 11
S3: line = 456, score = 0.370
---
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
S2: line = 457, bytes = 56, words = 9
S3: line = 457, score = 0.000
---
The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
S2: line = 459, bytes = 66, words = 14
S3: line = 459, score = 0.223
---
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
S2: line = 460, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 460, score = 0.229
---
to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
S2: line = 461, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 461, score = 0.358
---
known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the
S2: line = 462, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 462, score = 0.223
---
Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than
S2: line = 463, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 463, score = 0.000
---
you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without
S2: line = 464, bytes = 66, words = 12
S3: line = 464, score = 0.000
---
knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its
S2: line = 465, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 465, score = 0.000
---
age, there was no more to be said.
S2: line = 466, bytes = 34, words = 8
S3: line = 466, score = 0.000
---
At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
S2: line = 468, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 468, score = 0.000
---
called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you
S2: line = 469, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 469, score = 0.217
---
dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse
S2: line = 470, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 470, score = 0.220
---
in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt
S2: line = 471, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 471, score = 0.445
---
sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
S2: line = 472, bytes = 65, words = 15
S3: line = 472, score = 0.000
---
'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This
S2: line = 474, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 474, score = 0.000

is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! "William

'Found WHAT?' said the Duck.
S2: line = 492, bytes = 28, words = 5
S3: line = 492, score = 0.266
---
'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what
S2: line = 494, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 494, score = 0.229

"it" means.'
S2: line = 495, bytes = 12, words = 2

'I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said the

to Alice as it spoke.
S2: line = 505, bytes = 21, words = 5
S3: line = 505, score = 0.000
---
'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to

S2: line = 508, bytes = 15, words = 4
S3: line = 508, score = 0.000

'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move

S2: line = 515, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 515, score = 0.220
---
the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
S2: line = 516, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 516, score = 0.220

tittered audibly.
S2: line = 517, bytes = 17, words = 2
S3: line = 517, score = 0.000

'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that
S2: line = 519, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 519, score = 0.000

the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'
S2: line = 520, bytes = 53, words = 12
S3: line = 520, score = 0.000

'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,
S2: line = 522, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 522, score = 0.000
---
but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,
S2: line = 523, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 523, score = 0.000
---
and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
S2: line = 524, bytes = 48, words = 9
S3: line = 524, score = 0.000
---
'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as
S2: line = 526, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 526, score = 0.217
---
you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell
S2: line = 527, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 527, score = 0.000

you how the Dodo managed it.)
S2: line = 528, bytes = 29, words = 6
S3: line = 528, score = 0.000
---
First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact
S2: line = 530, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 530, score = 0.223
---
shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed
S2: line = 531, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 531, score = 0.000
---
along the course, here and there. There was no 'One, two, three, and
S2: line = 532, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 532, score = 0.000
---
away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
S2: line = 533, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 533, score = 0.000
---
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
S2: line = 534, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 534, score = 0.000
---
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,
S2: line = 535, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 535, score = 0.000
---
the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded
S2: line = 536, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 536, score = 0.000
---
round it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'
S2: line = 537, bytes = 49, words = 9
S3: line = 537, score = 0.000
---
This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,
S2: line = 539, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 539, score = 0.000
---
and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead
S2: line = 540, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 540, score = 0.668
---
(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures
S2: line = 541, bytes = 67, words = 11
S3: line = 541, score = 0.000
---
of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,
S2: line = 542, bytes = 65, words = 13
S3: line = 542, score = 0.000
---
'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.'
S2: line = 543, bytes = 46, words = 8
S3: line = 543, score = 0.000
---
'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked.
S2: line = 545, bytes = 64, words = 13
S3: line = 545, score = 0.000
---
'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;
S2: line = 547, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 547, score = 0.226
---
and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused
S2: line = 548, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 548, score = 0.000
---
way, 'Prizes! Prizes!'
S2: line = 549, bytes = 22, words = 3
S3: line = 549, score = 0.284
---
Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
S2: line = 551, bytes = 68, words = 16
S3: line = 551, score = 0.000
---
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
S2: line = 552, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 552, score = 0.000
---
not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one
S2: line = 553, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 553, score = 0.000
---
a-piece all round.
S2: line = 554, bytes = 18, words = 4
S3: line = 554, score = 0.000
---
'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.
S2: line = 556, bytes = 62, words = 12
S3: line = 556, score = 0.000
---
'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in
S2: line = 558, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 558, score = 0.000
---
your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.
S2: line = 559, bytes = 43, words = 8
S3: line = 559, score = 0.000
---
'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.
S2: line = 561, bytes = 35, words = 6
S3: line = 561, score = 0.000
---
'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.
S2: line = 563, bytes = 35, words = 7
S3: line = 563, score = 0.000
---
Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
S2: line = 565, bytes = 66, words = 12
S3: line = 565, score = 0.000
---
presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant
S2: line = 566, bytes = 69, words = 11
S3: line = 566, score = 0.000
---
thimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.
S2: line = 567, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 567, score = 0.229
---
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
S2: line = 569, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 569, score = 0.000
---
that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
S2: line = 570, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 570, score = 0.000
---
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
S2: line = 571, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 571, score = 0.000
---
could.
S2: line = 572, bytes = 6, words = 1
S3: line = 572, score = 0.000
---
The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
S2: line = 574, bytes = 65, words = 13
S3: line = 574, score = 0.000
---
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
S2: line = 575, bytes = 66, words = 11
S3: line = 575, score = 0.000
---
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
S2: line = 576, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 576, score = 0.000
---
However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
S2: line = 577, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 577, score = 0.220
---
begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
S2: line = 578, bytes = 45, words = 8
S3: line = 578, score = 0.000
---
'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why
S2: line = 580, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 580, score = 0.000
---
it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
S2: line = 581, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 581, score = 0.000
---
would be offended again.
S2: line = 582, bytes = 24, words = 4
S3: line = 582, score = 0.000
---
'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
S2: line = 584, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 584, score = 0.220
---
sighing.
S2: line = 585, bytes = 8, words = 1
S3: line = 585, score = 0.000
---
'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at
S2: line = 587, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 587, score = 0.452
---
the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling
S2: line = 588, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 588, score = 0.000
---
about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was
S2: line = 589, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 589, score = 0.000
---
something like this:--

The Mouse only growled in reply.
S2: line = 655, bytes = 32, words = 6
S3: line = 655, score = 0.000
---
'Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after it; and the
S2: line = 657, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 657, score = 0.226
---
others all joined in chorus, 'Yes, please do!' but the Mouse only shook
S2: line = 658, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 658, score = 0.000
---
its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.
S2: line = 659, bytes = 50, words = 8
S3: line = 659, score = 0.000
---
'What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite
S2: line = 661, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 661, score = 0.000
---
out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her
S2: line = 662, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 662, score = 0.000
---
daughter 'Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
S2: line = 663, bytes = 64, words = 14
S3: line = 663, score = 0.000
---
YOUR temper!' 'Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the young Crab, a little
S2: line = 664, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 664, score = 0.000
---
snappishly. 'You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!'
S2: line = 665, bytes = 61, words = 11
S3: line = 665, score = 0.000
---
'I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud, addressing
S2: line = 667, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 667, score = 0.000
---
nobody in particular. 'She'd soon fetch it back!'
S2: line = 668, bytes = 49, words = 9
S3: line = 668, score = 0.242
---
'And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?' said the
S2: line = 670, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 670, score = 0.000
---
Lory.
S2: line = 671, bytes = 5, words = 1
S3: line = 671, score = 0.000
---
Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
S2: line = 673, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 673, score = 0.226
---
'Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice you
S2: line = 674, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 674, score = 0.220
---
can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
S2: line = 675, bytes = 67, words = 15
S3: line = 675, score = 0.000
---
she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!'
S2: line = 676, bytes = 48, words = 12
S3: line = 676, score = 0.000
---
This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
S2: line = 678, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 678, score = 0.000
---
birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
S2: line = 679, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 679, score = 0.000
---
carefully, remarking, 'I really must be getting home; the night-air
S2: line = 680, bytes = 67, words = 11
S3: line = 680, score = 0.000
---
doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to
S2: line = 681, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 681, score = 0.000
---
its children, 'Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!'
S2: line = 682, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 682, score = 0.000
---
On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.
S2: line = 683, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 683, score = 0.000
---
'I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a melancholy
S2: line = 685, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 685, score = 0.000
---
tone. 'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best
S2: line = 686, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 686, score = 0.217
---
cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
S2: line = 687, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 687, score = 0.000
---
any more!' And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
S2: line = 688, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 688, score = 0.353
---
lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard
S2: line = 689, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 689, score = 0.000
---
a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
S2: line = 690, bytes = 66, words = 12
S3: line = 690, score = 0.229
---
eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming
S2: line = 691, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 691, score = 0.000
---
back to finish his story.
S2: line = 692, bytes = 25, words = 5

CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
S2: line = 697, bytes = 45, words = 9
S3: line = 697, score = 0.000
---
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
S2: line = 699, bytes = 64, words = 11
S3: line = 699, score = 0.000
---
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
S2: line = 700, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 700, score = 0.000
---
it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
S2: line = 701, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 701, score = 0.000
---
my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
S2: line = 702, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 702, score = 0.353
---
ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a
S2: line = 703, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 703, score = 0.226
---
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,
S2: line = 704, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 704, score = 0.348
---
and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
S2: line = 705, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 705, score = 0.226
---
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in
S2: line = 706, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 706, score = 0.000
---
the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,
S2: line = 707, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 707, score = 0.000
---
had vanished completely.
S2: line = 708, bytes = 24, words = 3
S3: line = 708, score = 0.000
---
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
S2: line = 710, bytes = 66, words = 12
S3: line = 710, score = 0.000
---
called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing
S2: line = 711, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 711, score = 0.000
---
out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!
S2: line = 712, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 712, score = 0.343
---
Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once
S2: line = 713, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 713, score = 0.223
---
in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it
S2: line = 714, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 714, score = 0.000
---
had made.
S2: line = 715, bytes = 9, words = 2
S3: line = 715, score = 0.000
---
'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How
S2: line = 717, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 717, score = 0.223
---
surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him
S2: line = 718, bytes = 70, words = 17
S3: line = 718, score = 0.214
---
his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, she
S2: line = 719, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 719, score = 0.343
---
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
S2: line = 720, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 720, score = 0.000
---
plate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in without
S2: line = 721, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 721, score = 0.000
---
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
S2: line = 722, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 722, score = 0.229
---
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
S2: line = 723, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 723, score = 0.220
---
fan and gloves.
S2: line = 724, bytes = 15, words = 3
S3: line = 724, score = 0.284
---
'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for
S2: line = 726, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 726, score = 0.226
---
a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she
S2: line = 727, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 727, score = 0.000
---
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come
S2: line = 728, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 728, score = 0.229
---
here directly, and get ready for your walk!" "Coming in a minute,
S2: line = 729, bytes = 65, words = 12
S3: line = 729, score = 0.229
---
nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't
S2: line = 730, bytes = 72, words = 18
S3: line = 730, score = 0.000
---
think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it
S2: line = 731, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 731, score = 0.000
---
began ordering people about like that!'
S2: line = 732, bytes = 39, words = 6
S3: line = 732, score = 0.000
---
By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
S2: line = 734, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 734, score = 0.433
---
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs
S2: line = 735, bytes = 72, words = 17
S3: line = 735, score = 0.214
---
of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,
S2: line = 736, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 736, score = 0.217
---
and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little
S2: line = 737, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 737, score = 0.220
---
bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time
S2: line = 738, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 738, score = 0.000
---
with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it
S2: line = 739, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 739, score = 0.000
---
to her lips. 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said
S2: line = 740, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 740, score = 0.000
---
to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what
S2: line = 741, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 741, score = 0.000
---
this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really
S2: line = 742, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 742, score = 0.220
---
I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'
S2: line = 743, bytes = 51, words = 11
S3: line = 743, score = 0.000
---
It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
S2: line = 745, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 745, score = 0.000
---
drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
S2: line = 746, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 746, score = 0.229
---
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
S2: line = 747, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 747, score = 0.223
---
down the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't
S2: line = 748, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 748, score = 0.220
---
grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't
S2: line = 749, bytes = 72, words = 20
S3: line = 749, score = 0.000
---
drunk quite so much!'
S2: line = 750, bytes = 21, words = 4
S3: line = 750, score = 0.000
---
Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
S2: line = 752, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 752, score = 0.000
---
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
S2: line = 753, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 753, score = 0.445
---
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
S2: line = 754, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 754, score = 0.439
---
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
S2: line = 755, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 755, score = 0.000
---
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
S2: line = 756, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 756, score = 0.000
---
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 'Now I
S2: line = 757, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 757, score = 0.220
---
can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'
S2: line = 758, bytes = 58, words = 11
S3: line = 758, score = 0.000
---
Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
S2: line = 760, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 760, score = 0.358
---
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
S2: line = 761, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 761, score = 0.000
---
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
S2: line = 762, bytes = 66, words = 15
S3: line = 762, score = 0.000
---
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.
S2: line = 763, bytes = 34, words = 6
S3: line = 763, score = 0.259
---
'It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, 'when one wasn't
S2: line = 765, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 765, score = 0.000
---
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
S2: line = 766, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 766, score = 0.000
---
rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and
S2: line = 767, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 767, score = 0.220
---
yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
S2: line = 768, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 768, score = 0.000
---
CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that
S2: line = 769, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 769, score = 0.348
---
kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!
S2: line = 770, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 770, score = 0.000
---
There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I
S2: line = 771, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 771, score = 0.000
---
grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a sorrowful
S2: line = 772, bytes = 72, words = 17
S3: line = 772, score = 0.000
---
tone; 'at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE.'
S2: line = 773, bytes = 58, words = 13
S3: line = 773, score = 0.000
---
'But then,' thought Alice, 'shall I NEVER get any older than I am
S2: line = 775, bytes = 65, words = 13
S3: line = 775, score = 0.000
---
now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but
S2: line = 776, bytes = 65, words = 15
S3: line = 776, score = 0.220
---
then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'
S2: line = 777, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 777, score = 0.000
---
'Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. 'How can you learn
S2: line = 779, bytes = 65, words = 11
S3: line = 779, score = 0.233
---
lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all
S2: line = 780, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 780, score = 0.220
---
for any lesson-books!'
S2: line = 781, bytes = 22, words = 4
S3: line = 781, score = 0.274
---
And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making
S2: line = 783, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 783, score = 0.220
---
quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard
S2: line = 784, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 784, score = 0.226
---
a voice outside, and stopped to listen.
S2: line = 785, bytes = 39, words = 7
S3: line = 785, score = 0.000
---
'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!'
S2: line = 787, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 787, score = 0.226
---
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
S2: line = 788, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 788, score = 0.223
---
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
S2: line = 789, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 789, score = 0.223
---
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
S2: line = 790, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 790, score = 0.226
---
as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
S2: line = 791, bytes = 52, words = 12
S3: line = 791, score = 0.000
---
Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
S2: line = 793, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 793, score = 0.000
---
the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,
S2: line = 794, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 794, score = 0.000
---
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'll
S2: line = 795, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 795, score = 0.223
---
go round and get in at the window.'
S2: line = 796, bytes = 35, words = 8
S3: line = 796, score = 0.000
---
'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
S2: line = 798, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 798, score = 0.229
---
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
S2: line = 799, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 799, score = 0.000
---
hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
S2: line = 800, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 800, score = 0.000
---
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
S2: line = 801, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 801, score = 0.220
---
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
S2: line = 802, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 802, score = 0.353
---
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
S2: line = 803, bytes = 41, words = 7
S3: line = 803, score = 0.253
---
Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And
S2: line = 805, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 805, score = 0.000
---
then a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging
S2: line = 806, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 806, score = 0.000
---
for apples, yer honour!'
S2: line = 807, bytes = 24, words = 4
S3: line = 807, score = 0.274
---
'Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. 'Here! Come and
S2: line = 809, bytes = 70, words = 11
S3: line = 809, score = 0.233
---
help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)
S2: line = 810, bytes = 52, words = 10

'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'
S2: line = 812, bytes = 46, words = 10
S3: line = 812, score = 0.000
---
'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')
S2: line = 814, bytes = 60, words = 11
S3: line = 814, score = 0.000
---
'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
S2: line = 816, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 816, score = 0.220
---
window!'
S2: line = 817, bytes = 8, words = 1
S3: line = 817, score = 0.000
---
'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'
S2: line = 819, bytes = 58, words = 13
S3: line = 819, score = 0.226
---
'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'
S2: line = 821, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 821, score = 0.000
---
There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
S2: line = 823, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 823, score = 0.226
---
now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at
S2: line = 824, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 824, score = 0.000
---
all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her
S2: line = 825, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 825, score = 0.000
---
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
S2: line = 826, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 826, score = 0.000
---
TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a number of
S2: line = 827, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 827, score = 0.000
---
cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do
S2: line = 828, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 828, score = 0.226
---
next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm
S2: line = 829, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 829, score = 0.217
---
sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'
S2: line = 830, bytes = 46, words = 11
S3: line = 830, score = 0.233
---
She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
S2: line = 832, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 832, score = 0.226
---
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices
S2: line = 833, bytes = 66, words = 12
S3: line = 833, score = 0.000
---
all talking together: she made out the words: 'Where's the other
S2: line = 834, bytes = 64, words = 12
S3: line = 834, score = 0.000
---
ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill!
S2: line = 835, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 835, score = 0.000

fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em

together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll

S3: line = 837, score = 0.226

do well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this
S2: line = 838, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 838, score = 0.000
---
rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming
S2: line = 839, bytes = 65, words = 13
S3: line = 839, score = 0.000
---
down! Heads below!' (a loud crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I
S2: line = 840, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 840, score = 0.223
---
fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I
S2: line = 841, bytes = 71, words = 17
S3: line = 841, score = 0.428
---
won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to
S2: line = 842, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 842, score = 0.217
---
go down the chimney!'
S2: line = 843, bytes = 21, words = 4
S3: line = 843, score = 0.274
---
'Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice to
S2: line = 845, bytes = 67, words = 15
S3: line = 845, score = 0.220
---
herself. 'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in
S2: line = 846, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 846, score = 0.000
---
Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
S2: line = 847, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 847, score = 0.348
---
I THINK I can kick a little!'
S2: line = 848, bytes = 29, words = 7
S3: line = 848, score = 0.000
---
She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited
S2: line = 850, bytes = 66, words = 14
S3: line = 850, score = 0.575
---
till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)
S2: line = 851, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 851, score = 0.000
---
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
S2: line = 852, bytes = 69, words = 11
S3: line = 852, score = 0.000
---
saying to herself 'This is Bill,' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to
S2: line = 853, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 853, score = 0.000
---
see what would happen next.
S2: line = 854, bytes = 27, words = 5
S3: line = 854, score = 0.000
---
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!'
S2: line = 856, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 856, score = 0.226
---
then the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then
S2: line = 857, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 857, score = 0.000
---
silence, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandy
S2: line = 858, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 858, score = 0.000
---
now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
S2: line = 859, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 859, score = 0.220
---
us all about it!'
S2: line = 860, bytes = 17, words = 4
S3: line = 860, score = 0.000
---
Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ('That's Bill,' thought
S2: line = 862, bytes = 67, words = 11
S3: line = 862, score = 0.233
---
Alice,) 'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm
S2: line = 863, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 863, score = 0.000
---
a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me
S2: line = 864, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 864, score = 0.220
---
like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!'
S2: line = 865, bytes = 57, words = 14
S3: line = 865, score = 0.000
---
'So you did, old fellow!' said the others.
S2: line = 867, bytes = 42, words = 8
S3: line = 867, score = 0.247
---
'We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called
S2: line = 869, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 869, score = 0.223
---
out as loud as she could, 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!'
S2: line = 870, bytes = 61, words = 15
S3: line = 870, score = 0.000
---
There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, 'I
S2: line = 872, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 872, score = 0.000
---
wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the
S2: line = 873, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 873, score = 0.000
---
roof off.' After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
S2: line = 874, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 874, score = 0.000
---
Alice heard the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.'
S2: line = 875, bytes = 65, words = 12
S3: line = 875, score = 0.000
---
'A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
S2: line = 877, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 877, score = 0.226
---
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
S2: line = 878, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 878, score = 0.223
---
window, and some of them hit her in the face. 'I'll put a stop to this,'
S2: line = 879, bytes = 72, words = 17
S3: line = 879, score = 0.214
---
she said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not do that again!'
S2: line = 880, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 880, score = 0.000
---
which produced another dead silence.
S2: line = 881, bytes = 36, words = 5
S3: line = 881, score = 0.000
---
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
S2: line = 883, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 883, score = 0.000
---
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
S2: line = 884, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 884, score = 0.220
---
head. 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make
S2: line = 885, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 885, score = 0.000
---
SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must
S2: line = 886, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 886, score = 0.000
---
make me smaller, I suppose.'
S2: line = 887, bytes = 28, words = 5
S3: line = 887, score = 0.000
---
So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
S2: line = 889, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 889, score = 0.223
---
began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through
S2: line = 890, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 890, score = 0.000
---
the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little
S2: line = 891, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 891, score = 0.220
---
animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was
S2: line = 892, bytes = 68, words = 11
S3: line = 892, score = 0.000
---
in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
S2: line = 893, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 893, score = 0.000
---
something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
S2: line = 894, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 894, score = 0.000
---
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
S2: line = 895, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 895, score = 0.223
---
safe in a thick wood.
S2: line = 896, bytes = 21, words = 5
S3: line = 896, score = 0.000
---
'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered
S2: line = 898, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 898, score = 0.220
---
about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second
S2: line = 899, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 899, score = 0.000
---
thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be
S2: line = 900, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 900, score = 0.439
---
the best plan.'
S2: line = 901, bytes = 15, words = 3
S3: line = 901, score = 0.000
---
It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
S2: line = 903, bytes = 66, words = 12
S3: line = 903, score = 0.000
---
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
S2: line = 904, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 904, score = 0.000
---
how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
S2: line = 905, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 905, score = 0.000
---
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
S2: line = 906, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 906, score = 0.000
---
great hurry.
S2: line = 907, bytes = 12, words = 2
S3: line = 907, score = 0.000
---
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
S2: line = 909, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 909, score = 0.226
---
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!'
S2: line = 910, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 910, score = 0.229
---
said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but
S2: line = 911, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 911, score = 0.000
---
she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be
S2: line = 912, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 912, score = 0.223
---
hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of
S2: line = 913, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 913, score = 0.000
---
all her coaxing.
S2: line = 914, bytes = 16, words = 3
S3: line = 914, score = 0.000
---
Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
S2: line = 916, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 916, score = 0.000
---
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
S2: line = 917, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 917, score = 0.000
---
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
S2: line = 918, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 918, score = 0.220
---
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
S2: line = 919, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 919, score = 0.000
---
to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
S2: line = 920, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 920, score = 0.223
---
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
S2: line = 921, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 921, score = 0.000
---
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
S2: line = 922, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 922, score = 0.000
---
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
S2: line = 923, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 923, score = 0.000
---
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
S2: line = 924, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 924, score = 0.226
---
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
S2: line = 925, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 925, score = 0.000
---
little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
S2: line = 926, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 926, score = 0.810
---
all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
S2: line = 927, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 927, score = 0.439
---
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
S2: line = 928, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 928, score = 0.000
---
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
S2: line = 930, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 930, score = 0.226
---
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and
S2: line = 931, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 931, score = 0.000
---
till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
S2: line = 932, bytes = 58, words = 11
S3: line = 932, score = 0.233
---
'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant
S2: line = 934, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 934, score = 0.000
---
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
S2: line = 935, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 935, score = 0.226
---
leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd
S2: line = 936, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 936, score = 0.000
---
only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that
S2: line = 937, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 937, score = 0.220
---
I've got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I
S2: line = 938, bytes = 65, words = 17
S3: line = 938, score = 0.000
---
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
S2: line = 939, bytes = 65, words = 13
S3: line = 939, score = 0.000
---
question is, what?'
S2: line = 940, bytes = 19, words = 3
S3: line = 940, score = 0.000
---
The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
S2: line = 942, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 942, score = 0.000
---
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
S2: line = 943, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 943, score = 0.223
---
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
S2: line = 944, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 944, score = 0.000
---
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
S2: line = 945, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 945, score = 0.000
---
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
S2: line = 946, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 946, score = 0.000
---
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
S2: line = 947, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 947, score = 0.000
---
was on the top of it.
S2: line = 948, bytes = 21, words = 6
S3: line = 948, score = 0.000
---
She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
S2: line = 950, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 950, score = 0.000
---
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,
S2: line = 951, bytes = 68, words = 11
S3: line = 951, score = 0.000
---
that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long
S2: line = 952, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 952, score = 0.445
---
hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.

CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar

S3: line = 958, score = 0.259
---
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:
S2: line = 960, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 960, score = 0.226
---
at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed
S2: line = 961, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 961, score = 0.000
---
her in a languid, sleepy voice.
S2: line = 962, bytes = 31, words = 6
S3: line = 962, score = 0.000
---
'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.
S2: line = 964, bytes = 36, words = 6
S3: line = 964, score = 0.000
---
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
S2: line = 966, bytes = 70, words = 11
S3: line = 966, score = 0.233
---
rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know
S2: line = 967, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 967, score = 0.000

who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been

changed several times since then.'
S2: line = 969, bytes = 34, words = 5
S3: line = 969, score = 0.000
---
'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain
S2: line = 971, bytes = 66, words = 11
S3: line = 971, score = 0.000

yourself!'
S2: line = 972, bytes = 10, words = 1

'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not
S2: line = 974, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 974, score = 0.000
---
myself, you see.'
S2: line = 975, bytes = 17, words = 3
S3: line = 975, score = 0.000
---
'I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.
S2: line = 977, bytes = 36, words = 7
S3: line = 977, score = 0.000
---
'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely,
S2: line = 979, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 979, score = 0.000
---
'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
S2: line = 980, bytes = 66, words = 14
S3: line = 980, score = 0.223
---
different sizes in a day is very confusing.'
S2: line = 981, bytes = 44, words = 8
S3: line = 981, score = 0.000
---
'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.
S2: line = 983, bytes = 33, words = 6
S3: line = 983, score = 0.000
---
'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you
S2: line = 985, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 985, score = 0.223
---
have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then
S2: line = 986, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 986, score = 0.000
---
after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little
S2: line = 987, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 987, score = 0.223
---
queer, won't you?'
S2: line = 988, bytes = 18, words = 4
S3: line = 988, score = 0.000
---
'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.
S2: line = 990, bytes = 34, words = 6
S3: line = 990, score = 0.000
---
'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know
S2: line = 992, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 992, score = 0.229
---
is, it would feel very queer to ME.'
S2: line = 993, bytes = 36, words = 8
S3: line = 993, score = 0.247
---
'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?'
S2: line = 995, bytes = 58, words = 8
S3: line = 995, score = 0.000
---
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
S2: line = 997, bytes = 67, words = 11
S3: line = 997, score = 0.000
---
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY
S2: line = 998, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 998, score = 0.229
---
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think,
S2: line = 999, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 999, score = 0.000
---
you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'
S2: line = 1000, bytes = 41, words = 9
S3: line = 1000, score = 0.242
---
'Why?' said the Caterpillar.
S2: line = 1002, bytes = 28, words = 4
S3: line = 1002, score = 0.000
---
Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
S2: line = 1004, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 1004, score = 0.000
---
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant
S2: line = 1005, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 1005, score = 0.000
---
state of mind, she turned away.
S2: line = 1006, bytes = 31, words = 6
S3: line = 1006, score = 0.000
---
'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something important
S2: line = 1008, bytes = 72, words = 11
S3: line = 1008, score = 0.000
---
to say!'
S2: line = 1009, bytes = 8, words = 2
S3: line = 1009, score = 0.000
---
This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
S2: line = 1011, bytes = 68, words = 10
S3: line = 1011, score = 0.000
---
'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.
S2: line = 1013, bytes = 41, words = 6
S3: line = 1013, score = 0.000
---
'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
S2: line = 1015, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 1015, score = 0.226
---
could.
S2: line = 1016, bytes = 6, words = 1
S3: line = 1016, score = 0.000
---
'No,' said the Caterpillar.
S2: line = 1018, bytes = 27, words = 4
S3: line = 1018, score = 0.000
---
Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and
S2: line = 1020, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 1020, score = 0.000
---
perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some
S2: line = 1021, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 1021, score = 0.229
---
minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its
S2: line = 1022, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 1022, score = 0.000
---
arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think
S2: line = 1023, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1023, score = 0.000
---
you're changed, do you?'
S2: line = 1024, bytes = 24, words = 5
S3: line = 1024, score = 0.000
---
'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I
S2: line = 1026, bytes = 65, words = 15
S3: line = 1026, score = 0.000
---
used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'
S2: line = 1027, bytes = 63, words = 13
S3: line = 1027, score = 0.226
---
'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.
S2: line = 1029, bytes = 51, words = 8
S3: line = 1029, score = 0.000
---
'Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it all came
S2: line = 1031, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 1031, score = 0.000
---
different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
S2: line = 1032, bytes = 53, words = 8
S3: line = 1032, score = 0.000
---
'Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.
S2: line = 1034, bytes = 62, words = 9
S3: line = 1034, score = 0.242
---
Alice folded her hands, and began:--
S2: line = 1036, bytes = 36, words = 6
S3: line = 1036, score = 0.259
---
   'You are old, Father William,' the young man said,
S2: line = 1038, bytes = 53, words = 9
S3: line = 1038, score = 0.242
---
    'And your hair has become very white;
S2: line = 1039, bytes = 41, words = 7
S3: line = 1039, score = 0.000
---
   And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
S2: line = 1040, bytes = 47, words = 8
S3: line = 1040, score = 0.000
---
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?'
S2: line = 1041, bytes = 44, words = 9
S3: line = 1041, score = 0.000
---
   'In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,
S2: line = 1043, bytes = 52, words = 9
S3: line = 1043, score = 0.242
---
    'I feared it might injure the brain;
S2: line = 1044, bytes = 40, words = 7
S3: line = 1044, score = 0.253
---
   But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
S2: line = 1045, bytes = 48, words = 10
S3: line = 1045, score = 0.000
---
    Why, I do it again and again.'
S2: line = 1046, bytes = 34, words = 7
S3: line = 1046, score = 0.000
---
   'You are old,' said the youth, 'as I mentioned before,
S2: line = 1048, bytes = 57, words = 10
S3: line = 1048, score = 0.000
---
    And have grown most uncommonly fat;
S2: line = 1049, bytes = 39, words = 6
S3: line = 1049, score = 0.259
---
   Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
S2: line = 1050, bytes = 52, words = 10
S3: line = 1050, score = 0.000
---
    Pray, what is the reason of that?'
S2: line = 1051, bytes = 38, words = 7
S3: line = 1051, score = 0.000
---
   'In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
S2: line = 1053, bytes = 60, words = 12
S3: line = 1053, score = 0.000
---
    'I kept all my limbs very supple
S2: line = 1054, bytes = 36, words = 7
S3: line = 1054, score = 0.000
---
   By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
S2: line = 1055, bytes = 54, words = 10
S3: line = 1055, score = 0.000
---
    Allow me to sell you a couple?'
S2: line = 1056, bytes = 35, words = 7
S3: line = 1056, score = 0.000
---
   'You are old,' said the youth, 'and your jaws are too weak
S2: line = 1058, bytes = 61, words = 12
S3: line = 1058, score = 0.000

    For anything tougher than suet;
S2: line = 1059, bytes = 35, words = 5
S3: line = 1059, score = 0.266
---
   Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
S2: line = 1060, bytes = 60, words = 11
S3: line = 1060, score = 0.233
---
    Pray how did you manage to do it?'
S2: line = 1061, bytes = 38, words = 8
S3: line = 1061, score = 0.000
---
   'In my youth,' said his father, 'I took to the law,
S2: line = 1063, bytes = 54, words = 11
S3: line = 1063, score = 0.233
---
    And argued each case with my wife;
S2: line = 1064, bytes = 38, words = 7
S3: line = 1064, score = 0.000
---
   And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
S2: line = 1065, bytes = 54, words = 10
S3: line = 1065, score = 0.000
---
    Has lasted the rest of my life.'
S2: line = 1066, bytes = 36, words = 7
S3: line = 1066, score = 0.000
---
   'You are old,' said the youth, 'one would hardly suppose
S2: line = 1068, bytes = 59, words = 10
S3: line = 1068, score = 0.000

    That your eye was as steady as ever;
S2: line = 1069, bytes = 40, words = 8
S3: line = 1069, score = 0.000
---
   Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
S2: line = 1070, bytes = 52, words = 11
S3: line = 1070, score = 0.000
---
    What made you so awfully clever?'
S2: line = 1071, bytes = 37, words = 6
S3: line = 1071, score = 0.000
---
   'I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'
S2: line = 1073, bytes = 57, words = 9
S3: line = 1073, score = 0.000
---
    Said his father; 'don't give yourself airs!
S2: line = 1074, bytes = 47, words = 8
S3: line = 1074, score = 0.247
---
   Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
S2: line = 1075, bytes = 51, words = 11
S3: line = 1075, score = 0.000
---
    Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'
S2: line = 1076, bytes = 42, words = 9
S3: line = 1076, score = 0.242
---
'That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.
S2: line = 1079, bytes = 47, words = 8
S3: line = 1079, score = 0.000
---
'Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; 'some of the words
S2: line = 1081, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 1081, score = 0.000
---
have got altered.'
S2: line = 1082, bytes = 18, words = 3
S3: line = 1082, score = 0.000
---
'It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar decidedly, and
S2: line = 1084, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 1084, score = 0.229
---
there was silence for some minutes.
S2: line = 1085, bytes = 35, words = 6
S3: line = 1085, score = 0.259
---
The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
S2: line = 1087, bytes = 39, words = 7
S3: line = 1087, score = 0.253
---
'What size do you want to be?' it asked.
S2: line = 1089, bytes = 40, words = 9
S3: line = 1089, score = 0.000
---
'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one
S2: line = 1091, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 1091, score = 0.000
---
doesn't like changing so often, you know.'
S2: line = 1092, bytes = 42, words = 8
S3: line = 1092, score = 0.000
---
'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
S2: line = 1094, bytes = 37, words = 7
S3: line = 1094, score = 0.000
---
Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
S2: line = 1096, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 1096, score = 0.000
---
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
S2: line = 1097, bytes = 52, words = 10
S3: line = 1097, score = 0.238
---
'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.
S2: line = 1099, bytes = 44, words = 7
S3: line = 1099, score = 0.000
---
'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,'
S2: line = 1101, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 1101, score = 0.000
---
said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.'
S2: line = 1102, bytes = 59, words = 11
S3: line = 1102, score = 0.000
---
'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing
S2: line = 1104, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 1104, score = 0.000
---
itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
S2: line = 1105, bytes = 62, words = 11
S3: line = 1105, score = 0.000
---
'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And
S2: line = 1107, bytes = 67, words = 15
S3: line = 1107, score = 0.000
---
she thought of herself, 'I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
S2: line = 1108, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 1108, score = 0.000
---
offended!'
S2: line = 1109, bytes = 10, words = 1
S3: line = 1109, score = 0.000
---
'You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the
S2: line = 1111, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 1111, score = 0.000
---
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
S2: line = 1112, bytes = 46, words = 8
S3: line = 1112, score = 0.000
---
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In
S2: line = 1114, bytes = 66, words = 12
S3: line = 1114, score = 0.000
---
a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth
S2: line = 1115, bytes = 64, words = 13
S3: line = 1115, score = 0.000
---
and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
S2: line = 1116, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 1116, score = 0.223
---
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
S2: line = 1117, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 1117, score = 0.000
---
'One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
S2: line = 1118, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1118, score = 0.000
---
grow shorter.'
S2: line = 1119, bytes = 14, words = 2
S3: line = 1119, score = 0.000
---
'One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to herself.
S2: line = 1121, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 1121, score = 0.000
---
'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
S2: line = 1123, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 1123, score = 0.000
---
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
S2: line = 1124, bytes = 49, words = 10
S3: line = 1124, score = 0.000
---
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying
S2: line = 1126, bytes = 72, words = 11
S3: line = 1126, score = 0.233
---
to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly
S2: line = 1127, bytes = 67, words = 15
S3: line = 1127, score = 0.000
---
round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she
S2: line = 1128, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 1128, score = 0.229
---
stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit
S2: line = 1129, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 1129, score = 0.217
---
of the edge with each hand.
S2: line = 1130, bytes = 27, words = 6
S3: line = 1130, score = 0.000
---
'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
S2: line = 1132, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1132, score = 0.000
---
the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent
S2: line = 1133, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 1133, score = 0.220
---
blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
S2: line = 1134, bytes = 49, words = 9
S3: line = 1134, score = 0.242
---
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
S2: line = 1136, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 1136, score = 0.353
---
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
S2: line = 1137, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 1137, score = 0.000
---
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
S2: line = 1138, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 1138, score = 0.000
---
so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
S2: line = 1139, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 1139, score = 0.226
---
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
S2: line = 1140, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 1140, score = 0.000
---
lefthand bit.
S2: line = 1141, bytes = 13, words = 2
S3: line = 1141, score = 0.000

'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, which
S2: line = 1150, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 1150, score = 0.220
---
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
S2: line = 1151, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 1151, score = 0.229
---
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
S2: line = 1152, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1152, score = 0.445
---
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
S2: line = 1153, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 1153, score = 0.000
---
sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
S2: line = 1154, bytes = 43, words = 9
S3: line = 1154, score = 0.242
---
'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. 'And where HAVE my
S2: line = 1156, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 1156, score = 0.000
---
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?'
S2: line = 1157, bytes = 68, words = 16
S3: line = 1157, score = 0.000

She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,

except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
S2: line = 1159, bytes = 55, words = 9
S3: line = 1159, score = 0.000

As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she
S2: line = 1161, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 1161, score = 0.000

tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her
S2: line = 1162, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 1162, score = 0.439

neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had
S2: line = 1163, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 1163, score = 0.000

just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going
S2: line = 1164, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 1164, score = 0.226
---
to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops
S2: line = 1165, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 1165, score = 0.220

S2: line = 1166, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 1166, score = 0.000

her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and
S2: line = 1167, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 1167, score = 0.348
---
was beating her violently with its wings.
S2: line = 1168, bytes = 41, words = 7
S3: line = 1168, score = 0.000

'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.
S2: line = 1170, bytes = 31, words = 4
S3: line = 1170, score = 0.000

'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!'
S2: line = 1172, bytes = 60, words = 11
S3: line = 1172, score = 0.000
---
'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,
S2: line = 1174, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 1174, score = 0.000
---
and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems

'I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice.

'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried

Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
S2: line = 1184, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 1184, score = 0.000

saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

S3: line = 1185, score = 0.247

'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon;
S2: line = 1187, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 1187, score = 0.000

'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I

S3: line = 1189, score = 0.000

'I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was beginning to

'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the

'Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. 'I can see you're trying to

S3: line = 1202, score = 0.000

'I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
S2: line = 1204, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 1204, score = 0.000
---
the number of changes she had gone through that day.

S3: line = 1205, score = 0.000

'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
S2: line = 1207, bytes = 65, words = 13
S3: line = 1207, score = 0.000

contempt. 'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE

denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an

S3: line = 1211, score = 0.000

'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful

know.'
S2: line = 1215, bytes = 6, words = 1
S3: line = 1215, score = 0.000

'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're

a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'
S2: line = 1218, bytes = 41, words = 10
S3: line = 1218, score = 0.000

This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
S2: line = 1220, bytes = 66, words = 15
S3: line = 1220, score = 0.220
---
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're
S2: line = 1221, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 1221, score = 0.000
---
looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me
S2: line = 1222, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 1222, score = 0.220

whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'
S2: line = 1223, bytes = 43, words = 9
S3: line = 1223, score = 0.000
---
'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking
S2: line = 1225, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 1225, score = 0.000

for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't

S2: line = 1227, bytes = 15, words = 3
S3: line = 1227, score = 0.000

'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
S2: line = 1229, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 1229, score = 0.000
---
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as
S2: line = 1230, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 1230, score = 0.353
---
she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and
S2: line = 1231, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 1231, score = 0.229
---
every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she
S2: line = 1232, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 1232, score = 0.000
---
remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and
S2: line = 1233, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 1233, score = 0.000
---
she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the
S2: line = 1234, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1234, score = 0.223
---
other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
S2: line = 1235, bytes = 72, words = 11
S3: line = 1235, score = 0.000
---
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
S2: line = 1236, bytes = 55, words = 9
S3: line = 1236, score = 0.242
---
It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
S2: line = 1238, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 1238, score = 0.220
---
felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
S2: line = 1239, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 1239, score = 0.439
---
and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done
S2: line = 1240, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 1240, score = 0.000
---
now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going
S2: line = 1241, bytes = 70, words = 15

to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right

S2: line = 1243, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 1243, score = 0.000
---
to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open
S2: line = 1244, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 1244, score = 0.000
---
place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 'Whoever lives

S3: line = 1245, score = 0.358

there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,
S2: line = 1246, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 1246, score = 0.000

I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the
S2: line = 1247, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 1247, score = 0.223
---
righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she
S2: line = 1248, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1248, score = 0.000

had brought herself down to nine inches high.

CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper
S2: line = 1254, bytes = 26, words = 5
S3: line = 1254, score = 0.000
---
For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
S2: line = 1256, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1256, score = 0.223
---
to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
S2: line = 1257, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1257, score = 0.223
---
wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
S2: line = 1258, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 1258, score = 0.226
---
otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
S2: line = 1259, bytes = 64, words = 12
S3: line = 1259, score = 0.229
---
fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened
S2: line = 1260, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 1260, score = 0.226
---
by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
S2: line = 1261, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1261, score = 0.353
---
frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all
S2: line = 1262, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 1262, score = 0.364
---
over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,
S2: line = 1263, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1263, score = 0.223
---
and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
S2: line = 1264, bytes = 49, words = 11
S3: line = 1264, score = 0.233
---
The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
S2: line = 1266, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 1266, score = 0.452
---
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
S2: line = 1267, bytes = 65, words = 13
S3: line = 1267, score = 0.000
---
saying, in a solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen
S2: line = 1268, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 1268, score = 0.358
---
to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,
S2: line = 1269, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 1269, score = 0.364
---
only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen. An
S2: line = 1270, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 1270, score = 0.226
---
invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'
S2: line = 1271, bytes = 44, words = 7
S3: line = 1271, score = 0.253
---
Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.
S2: line = 1273, bytes = 65, words = 11
S3: line = 1273, score = 0.000
---
Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the
S2: line = 1275, bytes = 64, words = 14
S3: line = 1275, score = 0.000
---
wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
S2: line = 1276, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 1276, score = 0.353
---
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
S2: line = 1277, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 1277, score = 0.353

door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
S2: line = 1278, bytes = 39, words = 7
S3: line = 1278, score = 0.000
---
Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.
S2: line = 1280, bytes = 47, words = 9
S3: line = 1280, score = 0.000
---
'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for
S2: line = 1282, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1282, score = 0.353
---
two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you
S2: line = 1283, bytes = 67, words = 15
S3: line = 1283, score = 0.220

are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could
S2: line = 1284, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 1284, score = 0.000
---
possibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise
S2: line = 1285, bytes = 70, words = 11
S3: line = 1285, score = 0.000
---
going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then
S2: line = 1286, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 1286, score = 0.000

a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.
S2: line = 1287, bytes = 64, words = 14
S3: line = 1287, score = 0.000

'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'
S2: line = 1289, bytes = 49, words = 10
S3: line = 1289, score = 0.000

'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on
S2: line = 1291, bytes = 65, words = 12
S3: line = 1291, score = 0.229
---
without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance,
S2: line = 1292, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 1292, score = 0.226

if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'
S2: line = 1293, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 1293, score = 0.000

He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this
S2: line = 1294, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 1294, score = 0.000

Alice thought decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she
S2: line = 1295, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 1295, score = 0.000
---
said to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.
S2: line = 1296, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 1296, score = 0.000
---
But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she
S2: line = 1297, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 1297, score = 0.000
---
repeated, aloud.
S2: line = 1298, bytes = 16, words = 2
S3: line = 1298, score = 0.000

'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--'
S2: line = 1300, bytes = 59, words = 9
S3: line = 1300, score = 0.242
---
At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
S2: line = 1302, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 1302, score = 0.000
---
skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,
S2: line = 1303, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 1303, score = 0.226
---
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.
S2: line = 1304, bytes = 56, words = 11
S3: line = 1304, score = 0.000
---
'--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
S2: line = 1306, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 1306, score = 0.229
---
as if nothing had happened.
S2: line = 1307, bytes = 27, words = 5
S3: line = 1307, score = 0.000

'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
S2: line = 1309, bytes = 58, words = 13
S3: line = 1309, score = 0.000
---
'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. 'That's the first
S2: line = 1311, bytes = 63, words = 14
S3: line = 1311, score = 0.353

question, you know.'
S2: line = 1312, bytes = 20, words = 3
S3: line = 1312, score = 0.000
---
It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 'It's really
S2: line = 1314, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 1314, score = 0.000

dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue.
S2: line = 1315, bytes = 69, words = 11
S3: line = 1315, score = 0.233
---
It's enough to drive one crazy!'
S2: line = 1316, bytes = 32, words = 7
S3: line = 1316, score = 0.000
---
The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
S2: line = 1318, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 1318, score = 0.364
---
remark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for

days and days.'

S3: line = 1320, score = 0.000

'But what am I to do?' said Alice.
S2: line = 1322, bytes = 34, words = 8
S3: line = 1322, score = 0.000

'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.
S2: line = 1324, bytes = 59, words = 9

'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's
S2: line = 1326, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1326, score = 0.000
---
perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.
S2: line = 1327, bytes = 56, words = 10
S3: line = 1327, score = 0.000
---
The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
S2: line = 1329, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1329, score = 0.353
---
one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in
S2: line = 1330, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 1330, score = 0.000
---
the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring
S2: line = 1331, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 1331, score = 0.226
---
a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.
S2: line = 1332, bytes = 49, words = 10
S3: line = 1332, score = 0.238
---
'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself,
S2: line = 1334, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 1334, score = 0.000
---
as well as she could for sneezing.
S2: line = 1335, bytes = 34, words = 7
S3: line = 1335, score = 0.253
---
There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess
S2: line = 1337, bytes = 63, words = 13
S3: line = 1337, score = 0.000
---
sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
S2: line = 1338, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 1338, score = 0.229
---
alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen
S2: line = 1339, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 1339, score = 0.000
---
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on
S2: line = 1340, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 1340, score = 0.000
---
the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.
S2: line = 1341, bytes = 40, words = 8
S3: line = 1341, score = 0.247
---
'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
S2: line = 1343, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 1343, score = 0.226
---
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why
S2: line = 1344, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 1344, score = 0.353
---
your cat grins like that?'
S2: line = 1345, bytes = 26, words = 5
S3: line = 1345, score = 0.000
---
'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'
S2: line = 1347, bytes = 63, words = 13
S3: line = 1347, score = 0.000
---
She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
S2: line = 1349, bytes = 65, words = 12
S3: line = 1349, score = 0.000
---
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,
S2: line = 1350, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 1350, score = 0.000
---
and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--
S2: line = 1351, bytes = 57, words = 12
S3: line = 1351, score = 0.000
---
'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know
S2: line = 1353, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 1353, score = 0.220
---
that cats COULD grin.'
S2: line = 1354, bytes = 22, words = 4
S3: line = 1354, score = 0.000
---
'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'
S2: line = 1356, bytes = 55, words = 11
S3: line = 1356, score = 0.000
---
'I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite
S2: line = 1358, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1358, score = 0.223
---
pleased to have got into a conversation.
S2: line = 1359, bytes = 40, words = 7
S3: line = 1359, score = 0.000
---
'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.'
S2: line = 1361, bytes = 61, words = 13
S3: line = 1361, score = 0.226
---
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
S2: line = 1363, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 1363, score = 0.000
---
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
S2: line = 1364, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 1364, score = 0.000
---
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
S2: line = 1365, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 1365, score = 0.220
---
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
S2: line = 1366, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 1366, score = 0.226
---
the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a
S2: line = 1367, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 1367, score = 0.452
---
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
S2: line = 1368, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 1368, score = 0.000
---
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
S2: line = 1369, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1369, score = 0.000
---
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
S2: line = 1370, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1370, score = 0.000
---
'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down in
S2: line = 1372, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 1372, score = 0.223
---
an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually
S2: line = 1373, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 1373, score = 0.000
---
large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.
S2: line = 1374, bytes = 64, words = 12
S3: line = 1374, score = 0.229
---
'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse
S2: line = 1376, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 1376, score = 0.000
---
growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'
S2: line = 1377, bytes = 61, words = 12
S3: line = 1377, score = 0.229
---
'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get
S2: line = 1379, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 1379, score = 0.223
---
an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of
S2: line = 1380, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 1380, score = 0.000
---
what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes
S2: line = 1381, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 1381, score = 0.000
---
twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--'
S2: line = 1382, bytes = 46, words = 9
S3: line = 1382, score = 0.242
---
'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!'
S2: line = 1384, bytes = 57, words = 10
S3: line = 1384, score = 0.000
---
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
S2: line = 1386, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 1386, score = 0.000
---
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
S2: line = 1387, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1387, score = 0.000
---
be listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is
S2: line = 1388, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1388, score = 0.223
---
it twelve? I--'
S2: line = 1389, bytes = 15, words = 3
S3: line = 1389, score = 0.000
---
'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!'
S2: line = 1391, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 1391, score = 0.226
---
And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of
S2: line = 1392, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 1392, score = 0.000
---
lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of
S2: line = 1393, bytes = 72, words = 17
S3: line = 1393, score = 0.000
---
every line:
S2: line = 1394, bytes = 11, words = 2
S3: line = 1394, score = 0.000
---
   'Speak roughly to your little boy,
S2: line = 1396, bytes = 37, words = 6
S3: line = 1396, score = 0.000
---
    And beat him when he sneezes:
S2: line = 1397, bytes = 33, words = 6
S3: line = 1397, score = 0.000
---
   He only does it to annoy,
S2: line = 1398, bytes = 28, words = 6
S3: line = 1398, score = 0.000
---
    Because he knows it teases.'
S2: line = 1399, bytes = 32, words = 5
S3: line = 1399, score = 0.000
---
         CHORUS.
S2: line = 1401, bytes = 16, words = 1
S3: line = 1401, score = 0.000
---
 (In which the cook and the baby joined):--
S2: line = 1403, bytes = 43, words = 8
S3: line = 1403, score = 0.000
---
       'Wow! wow! wow!'
S2: line = 1405, bytes = 23, words = 3
S3: line = 1405, score = 0.000
---
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
S2: line = 1407, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 1407, score = 0.000
---
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
S2: line = 1408, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 1408, score = 0.226
---
that Alice could hardly hear the words:--
S2: line = 1409, bytes = 41, words = 7
S3: line = 1409, score = 0.000
---
   'I speak severely to my boy,
S2: line = 1411, bytes = 31, words = 6
S3: line = 1411, score = 0.000
---
    I beat him when he sneezes;
S2: line = 1412, bytes = 31, words = 6
S3: line = 1412, score = 0.000

   For he can thoroughly enjoy
S2: line = 1413, bytes = 30, words = 5
S3: line = 1413, score = 0.266
---
    The pepper when he pleases!'
S2: line = 1414, bytes = 32, words = 5
S3: line = 1414, score = 0.000
---
         CHORUS.
S2: line = 1416, bytes = 16, words = 1
S3: line = 1416, score = 0.000
---
       'Wow! wow! wow!'
S2: line = 1418, bytes = 23, words = 3
S3: line = 1418, score = 0.000
---
'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice,
S2: line = 1420, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 1420, score = 0.000
---
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to play
S2: line = 1421, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 1421, score = 0.217
---
croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw
S2: line = 1422, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 1422, score = 0.000
---
a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.
S2: line = 1423, bytes = 63, words = 14
S3: line = 1423, score = 0.223
---
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
S2: line = 1425, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 1425, score = 0.000
---
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just
S2: line = 1426, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 1426, score = 0.000
---
like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting
S2: line = 1427, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 1427, score = 0.229
---
like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and
S2: line = 1428, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 1428, score = 0.000
---
straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute
S2: line = 1429, bytes = 72, words = 11
S3: line = 1429, score = 0.370
---
or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
S2: line = 1430, bytes = 50, words = 13
S3: line = 1430, score = 0.000
---
As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
S2: line = 1432, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 1432, score = 0.217
---
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
S2: line = 1433, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 1433, score = 0.000
---
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried
S2: line = 1434, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 1434, score = 0.226
---
it out into the open air. 'IF I don't take this child away with me,'
S2: line = 1435, bytes = 68, words = 16
S3: line = 1435, score = 0.000
---
thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be
S2: line = 1436, bytes = 71, words = 17
S3: line = 1436, score = 0.000
---
murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the
S2: line = 1437, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1437, score = 0.000
---
little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
S2: line = 1438, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 1438, score = 0.000
---
'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing
S2: line = 1439, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 1439, score = 0.220

yourself.'
S2: line = 1440, bytes = 10, words = 1
S3: line = 1440, score = 0.000
---
The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to
S2: line = 1442, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 1442, score = 0.226
---
see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
S2: line = 1443, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 1443, score = 0.000
---
a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its
S2: line = 1444, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 1444, score = 0.000
---
eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not
S2: line = 1445, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 1445, score = 0.229
---
like the look of the thing at all. 'But perhaps it was only sobbing,'
S2: line = 1446, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1446, score = 0.000
---
she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any
S2: line = 1447, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1447, score = 0.000
---
tears.
S2: line = 1448, bytes = 6, words = 1
S3: line = 1448, score = 0.000
---
No, there were no tears. 'If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,'
S2: line = 1450, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 1450, score = 0.000
---
said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
S2: line = 1451, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 1451, score = 0.000
---
now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
S2: line = 1452, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 1452, score = 0.000
---
to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.
S2: line = 1453, bytes = 58, words = 12
S3: line = 1453, score = 0.229
---
Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do with
S2: line = 1455, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 1455, score = 0.000
---
this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently,
S2: line = 1456, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 1456, score = 0.000
---
that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could
S2: line = 1457, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 1457, score = 0.445
---
be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she
S2: line = 1458, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 1458, score = 0.000
---
felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.
S2: line = 1459, bytes = 63, words = 13
S3: line = 1459, score = 0.452
---
So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see
S2: line = 1461, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 1461, score = 0.452
---
it trot away quietly into the wood. 'If it had grown up,' she said
S2: line = 1462, bytes = 66, words = 14
S3: line = 1462, score = 0.000
---
to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
S2: line = 1463, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 1463, score = 0.000
---
rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began thinking over other
S2: line = 1464, bytes = 66, words = 12
S3: line = 1464, score = 0.000
---
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
S2: line = 1465, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1465, score = 0.000
---
to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she
S2: line = 1466, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1466, score = 0.223
---
was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a
S2: line = 1467, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 1467, score = 0.000
---
tree a few yards off.
S2: line = 1468, bytes = 21, words = 5
S3: line = 1468, score = 0.266

The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
S2: line = 1470, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 1470, score = 0.000
---
thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she
S2: line = 1471, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 1471, score = 0.223
---
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.
S2: line = 1472, bytes = 46, words = 9
S3: line = 1472, score = 0.242
---
'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
S2: line = 1474, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 1474, score = 0.000
---
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.
S2: line = 1475, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 1475, score = 0.000
---
'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on. 'Would you
S2: line = 1476, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 1476, score = 0.223
---
tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'
S2: line = 1477, bytes = 52, words = 11
S3: line = 1477, score = 0.467
---
'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.
S2: line = 1479, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 1479, score = 0.000
---
'I don't much care where--' said Alice.
S2: line = 1481, bytes = 39, words = 8
S3: line = 1481, score = 0.000
---
'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.
S2: line = 1483, bytes = 56, words = 12
S3: line = 1483, score = 0.229
---
'--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.
S2: line = 1485, bytes = 62, words = 11
S3: line = 1485, score = 0.233
---
'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long
S2: line = 1487, bytes = 66, words = 15
S3: line = 1487, score = 0.220
---
enough.'
S2: line = 1488, bytes = 8, words = 1
S3: line = 1488, score = 0.000
---
Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.
S2: line = 1490, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 1490, score = 0.226
---
'What sort of people live about here?'
S2: line = 1491, bytes = 38, words = 7
S3: line = 1491, score = 0.000
---
'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives
S2: line = 1493, bytes = 69, words = 12

'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad.

S3: line = 1499, score = 0.000

You're mad.'
S2: line = 1500, bytes = 12, words = 3
S3: line = 1500, score = 0.000

'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.
S2: line = 1502, bytes = 38, words = 9
S3: line = 1502, score = 0.000

'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'
S2: line = 1504, bytes = 62, words = 13
S3: line = 1504, score = 0.000

Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how
S2: line = 1506, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 1506, score = 0.000

do you know that you're mad?'

S3: line = 1507, score = 0.000

'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?'

'I suppose so,' said Alice.
S2: line = 1511, bytes = 27, words = 5
S3: line = 1511, score = 0.000

'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry,
S2: line = 1513, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 1513, score = 0.000

and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and
S2: line = 1514, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 1514, score = 0.000

wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'
S2: line = 1515, bytes = 47, words = 11
S3: line = 1515, score = 0.000

'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.

S3: line = 1517, score = 0.000

'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with the

S3: line = 1520, score = 0.000

'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited

yet.'
S2: line = 1523, bytes = 5, words = 1
S3: line = 1523, score = 0.000

'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.
S2: line = 1525, bytes = 50, words = 10
S3: line = 1525, score = 0.000
---
Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
S2: line = 1527, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1527, score = 0.000
---
things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
S2: line = 1528, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 1528, score = 0.000

it suddenly appeared again.
S2: line = 1529, bytes = 27, words = 4
S3: line = 1529, score = 0.000
---
'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. 'I'd nearly
S2: line = 1531, bytes = 64, words = 14

forgotten to ask.'
S2: line = 1532, bytes = 18, words = 3
S3: line = 1532, score = 0.284
---
'It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
S2: line = 1534, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 1534, score = 0.000
---
in a natural way.
S2: line = 1535, bytes = 17, words = 4
S3: line = 1535, score = 0.274
---
'I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.
S2: line = 1537, bytes = 55, words = 10
S3: line = 1537, score = 0.000
---
Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
S2: line = 1539, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1539, score = 0.000
---
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
S2: line = 1540, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 1540, score = 0.000

which the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she
S2: line = 1541, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1541, score = 0.000

said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and

S3: line = 1542, score = 0.000

perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as
S2: line = 1543, bytes = 69, words = 17
S3: line = 1543, score = 0.000

it was in March.' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
S2: line = 1544, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 1544, score = 0.000
---
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.

S3: line = 1545, score = 0.000

'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.
S2: line = 1547, bytes = 40, words = 9
S3: line = 1547, score = 0.242
---
'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and
S2: line = 1549, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 1549, score = 0.000

vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'
S2: line = 1550, bytes = 49, words = 8
S3: line = 1550, score = 0.000
---
'All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
S2: line = 1552, bytes = 66, words = 12
S3: line = 1552, score = 0.000
---
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
S2: line = 1553, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 1553, score = 0.000
---
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.
S2: line = 1554, bytes = 49, words = 10
S3: line = 1554, score = 0.000
---
'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin
S2: line = 1556, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 1556, score = 0.000

without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'
S2: line = 1557, bytes = 66, words = 15
S3: line = 1557, score = 0.000
---
She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house
S2: line = 1559, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 1559, score = 0.223
---
of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
S2: line = 1560, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1560, score = 0.000

chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It
S2: line = 1561, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 1561, score = 0.226

was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
S2: line = 1562, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 1562, score = 0.000
---
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to
S2: line = 1563, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 1563, score = 0.000
---
about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,
S2: line = 1564, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 1564, score = 0.226
---
saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost
S2: line = 1565, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 1565, score = 0.000

wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!'

CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party
S2: line = 1571, bytes = 28, words = 6
S3: line = 1571, score = 0.000

There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
S2: line = 1573, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 1573, score = 0.217
---
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
S2: line = 1574, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 1574, score = 0.000
---
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
S2: line = 1575, bytes = 63, words = 13
S3: line = 1575, score = 0.226
---
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very
S2: line = 1576, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 1576, score = 0.000
---
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I
S2: line = 1577, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 1577, score = 0.229
---
suppose it doesn't mind.'
S2: line = 1578, bytes = 25, words = 5
S3: line = 1578, score = 0.000
---
The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
S2: line = 1580, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1580, score = 0.000
---
one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alice
S2: line = 1581, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 1581, score = 0.000
---
coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat
S2: line = 1582, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 1582, score = 0.000
---
down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.
S2: line = 1583, bytes = 50, words = 12
S3: line = 1583, score = 0.229
---
'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
S2: line = 1585, bytes = 61, words = 11
S3: line = 1585, score = 0.000
---
Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
S2: line = 1587, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1587, score = 0.000
---
'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.
S2: line = 1588, bytes = 37, words = 8
S3: line = 1588, score = 0.000
---
'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.
S2: line = 1590, bytes = 39, words = 8
S3: line = 1590, score = 0.000
---
'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.
S2: line = 1592, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 1592, score = 0.000
---
'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said
S2: line = 1594, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1594, score = 0.223
---
the March Hare.
S2: line = 1595, bytes = 15, words = 3
S3: line = 1595, score = 0.000
---
'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great
S2: line = 1597, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 1597, score = 0.217
---
many more than three.'
S2: line = 1598, bytes = 22, words = 4
S3: line = 1598, score = 0.000
---
'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice
S2: line = 1600, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 1600, score = 0.000
---
for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.
S2: line = 1601, bytes = 66, words = 12
S3: line = 1601, score = 0.364
---
'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some
S2: line = 1603, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 1603, score = 0.000
---
severity; 'it's very rude.'
S2: line = 1604, bytes = 27, words = 5
S3: line = 1604, score = 0.000
---
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID
S2: line = 1606, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1606, score = 0.000
---
was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'
S2: line = 1607, bytes = 42, words = 9
S3: line = 1607, score = 0.000
---
'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they've
S2: line = 1609, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 1609, score = 0.223
---
begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.
S2: line = 1610, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 1610, score = 0.000
---
'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the
S2: line = 1612, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 1612, score = 0.217
---
March Hare.
S2: line = 1613, bytes = 11, words = 2
S3: line = 1613, score = 0.000
---
'Exactly so,' said Alice.
S2: line = 1615, bytes = 25, words = 4
S3: line = 1615, score = 0.000
---
'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.
S2: line = 1617, bytes = 60, words = 12
S3: line = 1617, score = 0.000
---
'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I
S2: line = 1619, bytes = 64, words = 13
S3: line = 1619, score = 0.000
---
say--that's the same thing, you know.'
S2: line = 1620, bytes = 38, words = 8
S3: line = 1620, score = 0.000
---
'Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well say
S2: line = 1622, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 1622, score = 0.000

that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see"!'
S2: line = 1623, bytes = 65, words = 16
S3: line = 1623, score = 0.000
---
'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that "I like what I
S2: line = 1625, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 1625, score = 0.000

get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'
S2: line = 1626, bytes = 47, words = 11
S3: line = 1626, score = 0.000
---
'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
S2: line = 1628, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 1628, score = 0.000
---
talking in his sleep, 'that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thing
S2: line = 1629, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1629, score = 0.000
---
as "I sleep when I breathe"!'
S2: line = 1630, bytes = 29, words = 6
S3: line = 1630, score = 0.000
---
'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the
S2: line = 1632, bytes = 62, words = 13
S3: line = 1632, score = 0.000
---
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice
S2: line = 1633, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 1633, score = 0.229
---
thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,
S2: line = 1634, bytes = 67, words = 11
S3: line = 1634, score = 0.000
---
which wasn't much.
S2: line = 1635, bytes = 18, words = 4
S3: line = 1635, score = 0.000
---
The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month
S2: line = 1637, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1637, score = 0.223
---
is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
S2: line = 1638, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 1638, score = 0.000
---
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
S2: line = 1639, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 1639, score = 0.000
---
and holding it to his ear.
S2: line = 1640, bytes = 26, words = 6
S3: line = 1640, score = 0.000
---
Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'
S2: line = 1642, bytes = 54, words = 9
S3: line = 1642, score = 0.242
---
'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit
S2: line = 1644, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 1644, score = 0.000

the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.
S2: line = 1645, bytes = 55, words = 10
S3: line = 1645, score = 0.000
---
'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.
S2: line = 1647, bytes = 56, words = 10
S3: line = 1647, score = 0.000
---
'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled:
S2: line = 1649, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 1649, score = 0.000
---
'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'
S2: line = 1650, bytes = 52, words = 11
S3: line = 1650, score = 0.000
---
The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
S2: line = 1652, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 1652, score = 0.000
---
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
S2: line = 1653, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 1653, score = 0.000
---
nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter,
S2: line = 1654, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 1654, score = 0.226
---
you know.'
S2: line = 1655, bytes = 10, words = 2
S3: line = 1655, score = 0.000
---
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What a
S2: line = 1657, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 1657, score = 0.000
---
funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't
S2: line = 1658, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 1658, score = 0.223

tell what o'clock it is!'
S2: line = 1659, bytes = 25, words = 6
S3: line = 1659, score = 0.000
---
'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you what
S2: line = 1661, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 1661, score = 0.000

year it is?'
S2: line = 1662, bytes = 12, words = 3
S3: line = 1662, score = 0.000
---
'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it
S2: line = 1664, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 1664, score = 0.000
---
stays the same year for such a long time together.'
S2: line = 1665, bytes = 51, words = 10
S3: line = 1665, score = 0.475
---
'Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.
S2: line = 1667, bytes = 52, words = 10
S3: line = 1667, score = 0.000
---
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no
S2: line = 1669, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 1669, score = 0.229
---
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quite
S2: line = 1670, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 1670, score = 0.000
---
understand you,' she said, as politely as she could.
S2: line = 1671, bytes = 52, words = 9
S3: line = 1671, score = 0.000
---
'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little
S2: line = 1673, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 1673, score = 0.000
---
hot tea upon its nose.
S2: line = 1674, bytes = 22, words = 5
S3: line = 1674, score = 0.000
---
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its

S3: line = 1676, score = 0.000

eyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.'
S2: line = 1677, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 1677, score = 0.000
---
'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice
S2: line = 1679, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 1679, score = 0.000
---
again.
S2: line = 1680, bytes = 6, words = 1
S3: line = 1680, score = 0.000

'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.

'Nor I,' said the March Hare.
S2: line = 1686, bytes = 29, words = 6
S3: line = 1686, score = 0.000

Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the

S3: line = 1689, score = 0.000

'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk

'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.

S3: line = 1694, score = 0.000

'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.
S2: line = 1696, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 1696, score = 0.000

'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'
S2: line = 1697, bytes = 42, words = 9
S3: line = 1697, score = 0.000

'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time

S3: line = 1704, score = 0.223

('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)

S3: line = 1709, score = 0.000

'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I
S2: line = 1711, bytes = 71, words = 11

'Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to

The Hatter shook his head mournfully. 'Not I!' he replied. 'We

'I've heard something like it,' said Alice.
S2: line = 1729, bytes = 43, words = 8
S3: line = 1729, score = 0.000

'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--

Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle,

S3: line = 1737, score = 0.000

'Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 'when the

'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't

S3: line = 1748, score = 0.000

A bright idea came into Alice's head. 'Is that the reason so many

'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time,

'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.

'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get used up.'
S2: line = 1758, bytes = 59, words = 11
S3: line = 1758, score = 0.000

'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice ventured
S2: line = 1760, bytes = 71, words = 12

to ask.

'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.

'I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.'

S3: line = 1764, score = 0.000

'I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at the

proposal.
S2: line = 1767, bytes = 9, words = 1
S3: line = 1767, score = 0.000

'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And
S2: line = 1769, bytes = 68, words = 11
S3: line = 1769, score = 0.000

they pinched it on both sides at once.
S2: line = 1770, bytes = 38, words = 8
S3: line = 1770, score = 0.000

The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a
S2: line = 1772, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 1772, score = 0.000

hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard every word you fellows were saying.'

S3: line = 1773, score = 0.370

'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.

'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.

'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again

'What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest in

S3: line = 1790, score = 0.000

'So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY ill.'

Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of

S3: line = 1797, score = 0.459

living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But

why did they live at the bottom of a well?'

'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

S3: line = 1801, score = 0.000

'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't

'Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked triumphantly.
S2: line = 1811, bytes = 67, words = 10
S3: line = 1811, score = 0.000
---
Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself
S2: line = 1813, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 1813, score = 0.000
---
to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
S2: line = 1814, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1814, score = 0.000

repeated her question. 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'
S2: line = 1815, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 1815, score = 0.000

The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
S2: line = 1817, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 1817, score = 0.000
---
said, 'It was a treacle-well.'
S2: line = 1818, bytes = 30, words = 6
S3: line = 1818, score = 0.000

'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the

S3: line = 1820, score = 0.000

Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily
S2: line = 1821, bytes = 65, words = 12
S3: line = 1821, score = 0.000

remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for

'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I

'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.

S3: line = 1837, score = 0.000

He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
S2: line = 1839, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 1839, score = 0.223

moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took
S2: line = 1840, bytes = 66, words = 11
S3: line = 1840, score = 0.000

the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any

advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than

Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very

S3: line = 1845, score = 0.000

cautiously: 'But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle

'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should

'But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to

This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for

some time without interrupting it.

'Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, 'I don't

'Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.
S2: line = 1880, bytes = 43, words = 8
S3: line = 1880, score = 0.000
---
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
S2: line = 1882, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 1882, score = 0.000
---
great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
S2: line = 1883, bytes = 70, words = 11
S3: line = 1883, score = 0.233
---
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
S2: line = 1884, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 1884, score = 0.000
---
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
S2: line = 1885, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 1885, score = 0.000
---
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into

S3: line = 1887, score = 0.000

'At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she picked her
S2: line = 1889, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 1889, score = 0.000

way through the wood. 'It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all
S2: line = 1890, bytes = 72, words = 16

my life!'
S2: line = 1891, bytes = 9, words = 2
S3: line = 1891, score = 0.000
---
Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
S2: line = 1893, bytes = 67, words = 15
S3: line = 1893, score = 0.000
---
leading right into it. 'That's very curious!' she thought. 'But
S2: line = 1894, bytes = 63, words = 11
S3: line = 1894, score = 0.000
---
everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.' And in
S2: line = 1895, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 1895, score = 0.000

she went.
S2: line = 1896, bytes = 9, words = 2
S3: line = 1896, score = 0.000

Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
S2: line = 1898, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1898, score = 0.445

glass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself,
S2: line = 1899, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 1899, score = 0.000

and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
S2: line = 1900, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 1900, score = 0.000
---
led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she

S3: line = 1901, score = 0.000

had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:
S2: line = 1902, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 1902, score = 0.217

then she walked down the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at

S3: line = 1903, score = 0.452

last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool

fountains.

A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses

S3: line = 1912, score = 0.000
---
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
S2: line = 1913, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 1913, score = 0.000

painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went
S2: line = 1914, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 1914, score = 0.000
---
nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of
S2: line = 1915, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 1915, score = 0.000
---
them say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like

S3: line = 1917, score = 0.000

'I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; 'Seven jogged my

elbow.'
S2: line = 1920, bytes = 7, words = 1
S3: line = 1920, score = 0.000

On which Seven looked up and said, 'That's right, Five! Always lay the

S3: line = 1923, score = 0.000

'YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. 'I heard the Queen say only
S2: line = 1925, bytes = 63, words = 13
S3: line = 1925, score = 0.226

yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'
S2: line = 1926, bytes = 39, words = 6
S3: line = 1926, score = 0.000

'What for?' said the one who had spoken first.
S2: line = 1928, bytes = 46, words = 9
S3: line = 1928, score = 0.384
---
'That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.
S2: line = 1930, bytes = 48, words = 9
S3: line = 1930, score = 0.000
---
'Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, 'and I'll tell him--it was for

Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun 'Well, of all the unjust

things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching
S2: line = 1936, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 1936, score = 0.226
---
them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and
S2: line = 1937, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 1937, score = 0.000
---
all of them bowed low.
S2: line = 1938, bytes = 22, words = 5
S3: line = 1938, score = 0.000
---
'Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, 'why you are painting
S2: line = 1940, bytes = 72, words = 13

those roses?'
S2: line = 1941, bytes = 13, words = 2
S3: line = 1941, score = 0.000

Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low

was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.
S2: line = 1946, bytes = 67, words = 15
S3: line = 1946, score = 0.220
---
So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to--' At this
S2: line = 1947, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 1947, score = 0.000
---
moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
S2: line = 1948, bytes = 69, words = 11
S3: line = 1948, score = 0.233
---
out 'The Queen! The Queen!' and the three gardeners instantly threw
S2: line = 1949, bytes = 67, words = 11
S3: line = 1949, score = 0.000
---
themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,
S2: line = 1950, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 1950, score = 0.459
---
and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.
S2: line = 1951, bytes = 47, words = 9
S3: line = 1951, score = 0.000
---
First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like
S2: line = 1953, bytes = 66, words = 11
S3: line = 1953, score = 0.233
---
the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the

S3: line = 1954, score = 0.358

corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
S2: line = 1955, bytes = 68, words = 11
S3: line = 1955, score = 0.000
---
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
S2: line = 1956, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 1956, score = 0.000
---
the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
S2: line = 1957, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 1957, score = 0.000
---
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented
S2: line = 1958, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 1958, score = 0.000

with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among
S2: line = 1959, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 1959, score = 0.000

them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried
S2: line = 1960, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 1960, score = 0.000
---
nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
S2: line = 1961, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 1961, score = 0.000
---
noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's
S2: line = 1962, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 1962, score = 0.229
---
crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand
S2: line = 1963, bytes = 62, words = 12
S3: line = 1963, score = 0.000

procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
S2: line = 1964, bytes = 46, words = 8
S3: line = 1964, score = 0.000
---
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
S2: line = 1966, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 1966, score = 0.445
---
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
S2: line = 1967, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 1967, score = 0.000
---
of such a rule at processions; 'and besides, what would be the use of
S2: line = 1968, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 1968, score = 0.000
---
a procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon their
S2: line = 1969, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 1969, score = 0.226
---
faces, so that they couldn't see it?' So she stood still where she was,
S2: line = 1970, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 1970, score = 0.220
---
and waited.
S2: line = 1971, bytes = 11, words = 2
S3: line = 1971, score = 0.000

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked
S2: line = 1973, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 1973, score = 0.000
---
at her, and the Queen said severely 'Who is this?' She said it to the
S2: line = 1974, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 1974, score = 0.000
---
Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.
S2: line = 1975, bytes = 52, words = 10
S3: line = 1975, score = 0.000
---
'Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
S2: line = 1977, bytes = 70, words = 11
S3: line = 1977, score = 0.000
---
Alice, she went on, 'What's your name, child?'
S2: line = 1978, bytes = 46, words = 9
S3: line = 1978, score = 0.000
---
'My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very politely;
S2: line = 1980, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 1980, score = 0.000
---
but she added, to herself, 'Why, they're only a pack of cards, after

S3: line = 1982, score = 0.000
---
'And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who
S2: line = 1984, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 1984, score = 0.000
---
were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their

S3: line = 1985, score = 0.223

faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the
S2: line = 1986, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 1986, score = 0.220
---
pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or
S2: line = 1987, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 1987, score = 0.000
---
courtiers, or three of her own children.
S2: line = 1988, bytes = 40, words = 7
S3: line = 1988, score = 0.000

'How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage. 'It's no

S2: line = 1991, bytes = 18, words = 3
S3: line = 1991, score = 0.000

The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
S2: line = 1993, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 1993, score = 0.358
---
moment like a wild beast, screamed 'Off with her head! Off--'
S2: line = 1994, bytes = 61, words = 11
S3: line = 1994, score = 0.000

'Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was

S3: line = 1996, score = 0.000

silent.
S2: line = 1997, bytes = 7, words = 1
S3: line = 1997, score = 0.000

The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my

The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave 'Turn them

over!'

The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

'Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
S2: line = 2007, bytes = 64, words = 13
S3: line = 2007, score = 0.000

gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
S2: line = 2008, bytes = 71, words = 12

the royal children, and everybody else.

turning to the rose-tree, she went on, 'What HAVE you been doing here?'

S3: line = 2012, score = 0.000

'May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, going

'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the

soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran

others.

'Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers shouted

The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was
S2: line = 2034, bytes = 66, words = 12
S3: line = 2034, score = 0.000

evidently meant for her.

'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,
S2: line = 2039, bytes = 67, words = 11
S3: line = 2039, score = 0.000

wondering very much what would happen next.

'Very,' said Alice: '--where's the Duchess?'

S3: line = 2045, score = 0.000

'Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked

anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon

tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's under

sentence of execution.'

S3: line = 2050, score = 0.000
---
'What for?' said Alice.
S2: line = 2052, bytes = 23, words = 4
S3: line = 2052, score = 0.274
---
'Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.
S2: line = 2054, bytes = 47, words = 9
S3: line = 2054, score = 0.000
---
'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity. I said
S2: line = 2056, bytes = 69, words = 18
S3: line = 2056, score = 0.000
---
"What for?"'
S2: line = 2057, bytes = 12, words = 2
S3: line = 2057, score = 0.295
---
'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little
S2: line = 2059, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 2059, score = 0.000
---
scream of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
S2: line = 2060, bytes = 68, words = 11
S3: line = 2060, score = 0.233
---
tone. 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the
S2: line = 2061, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 2061, score = 0.000
---
Queen said--'
S2: line = 2062, bytes = 13, words = 2
S3: line = 2062, score = 0.000
---
'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and
S2: line = 2064, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 2064, score = 0.000
---
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
S2: line = 2065, bytes = 70, words = 11
S3: line = 2065, score = 0.000
---
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
S2: line = 2066, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 2066, score = 0.223
---
began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in
S2: line = 2067, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 2067, score = 0.000
---
her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,
S2: line = 2068, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 2068, score = 0.226
---
the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves
S2: line = 2069, bytes = 70, words = 11
S3: line = 2069, score = 0.233
---
up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.
S2: line = 2070, bytes = 60, words = 13
S3: line = 2070, score = 0.226
---
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
S2: line = 2072, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 2072, score = 0.459
---
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under
S2: line = 2073, bytes = 72, words = 11
S3: line = 2073, score = 0.000
---
her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got
S2: line = 2074, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 2074, score = 0.223
---
its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a
S2: line = 2075, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 2075, score = 0.000
---
blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,
S2: line = 2076, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 2076, score = 0.220
---
with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out
S2: line = 2077, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 2077, score = 0.000
---
laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin
S2: line = 2078, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 2078, score = 0.223
---
again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
S2: line = 2079, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 2079, score = 0.229
---
itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was
S2: line = 2080, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 2080, score = 0.000
---
generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the
S2: line = 2081, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 2081, score = 0.445
---
hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up
S2: line = 2082, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 2082, score = 0.000
---
and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the
S2: line = 2083, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 2083, score = 0.000
---
conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.
S2: line = 2084, bytes = 52, words = 9
S3: line = 2084, score = 0.000
---
The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
S2: line = 2086, bytes = 69, words = 11
S3: line = 2086, score = 0.233
---
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short
S2: line = 2087, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 2087, score = 0.358
---
time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
S2: line = 2088, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 2088, score = 0.226
---
shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' about once in a
S2: line = 2089, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 2089, score = 0.000
---
minute.
S2: line = 2090, bytes = 7, words = 1
S3: line = 2090, score = 0.000
---
Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
S2: line = 2092, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 2092, score = 0.217
---
dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
S2: line = 2093, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 2093, score = 0.000
---
'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfully
S2: line = 2094, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 2094, score = 0.000
---
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one
S2: line = 2095, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 2095, score = 0.223
---
left alive!'
S2: line = 2096, bytes = 12, words = 2
S3: line = 2096, score = 0.000
---
She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
S2: line = 2098, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 2098, score = 0.452
---
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance
S2: line = 2099, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 2099, score = 0.000
---
in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it
S2: line = 2100, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 2100, score = 0.223
---
a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself
S2: line = 2101, bytes = 70, words = 17
S3: line = 2101, score = 0.000
---
'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.'
S2: line = 2102, bytes = 62, words = 13
S3: line = 2102, score = 0.000
---
'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
S2: line = 2104, bytes = 66, words = 14
S3: line = 2104, score = 0.000
---
enough for it to speak with.
S2: line = 2105, bytes = 28, words = 6
S3: line = 2105, score = 0.259
---
Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. 'It's no use
S2: line = 2107, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 2107, score = 0.000
---
speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one
S2: line = 2108, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 2108, score = 0.000
---
of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
S2: line = 2109, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 2109, score = 0.000
---
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
S2: line = 2110, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 2110, score = 0.584
---
she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was
S2: line = 2111, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 2111, score = 0.000
---
enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.
S2: line = 2112, bytes = 54, words = 12
S3: line = 2112, score = 0.000
---
'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a
S2: line = 2114, bytes = 65, words = 14
S3: line = 2114, score = 0.223
---
complaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear
S2: line = 2115, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 2115, score = 0.000
---
oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular;
S2: line = 2116, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 2116, score = 0.000
---
at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how
S2: line = 2117, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 2117, score = 0.000
---
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the
S2: line = 2118, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 2118, score = 0.226
---
arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
S2: line = 2119, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 2119, score = 0.000
---
ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only
S2: line = 2120, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 2120, score = 0.000
---
it ran away when it saw mine coming!'
S2: line = 2121, bytes = 37, words = 8
S3: line = 2121, score = 0.000
---
'How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.
S2: line = 2123, bytes = 57, words = 13
S3: line = 2123, score = 0.000
---
'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed
S2: line = 2125, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 2125, score = 0.000
---
that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
S2: line = 2126, bytes = 63, words = 12
S3: line = 2126, score = 0.000
---
'--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'
S2: line = 2127, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 2127, score = 0.229
---
The Queen smiled and passed on.
S2: line = 2129, bytes = 31, words = 6
S3: line = 2129, score = 0.000
---
'Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and looking
S2: line = 2131, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 2131, score = 0.000
---
at the Cat's head with great curiosity.
S2: line = 2132, bytes = 39, words = 8
S3: line = 2132, score = 0.000
---
'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to
S2: line = 2134, bytes = 65, words = 14
S3: line = 2134, score = 0.223
---
introduce it.'
S2: line = 2135, bytes = 14, words = 2
S3: line = 2135, score = 0.000
---
'I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 'however, it may
S2: line = 2137, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 2137, score = 0.000
---
kiss my hand if it likes.'
S2: line = 2138, bytes = 26, words = 6
S3: line = 2138, score = 0.000
---
'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.
S2: line = 2140, bytes = 35, words = 7
S3: line = 2140, score = 0.000
---
'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!'
S2: line = 2142, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 2142, score = 0.000
---
He got behind Alice as he spoke.
S2: line = 2143, bytes = 32, words = 7
S3: line = 2143, score = 0.000
---
'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book,
S2: line = 2145, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 2145, score = 0.000
---
but I don't remember where.'
S2: line = 2146, bytes = 28, words = 6
S3: line = 2146, score = 0.000
---
'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called
S2: line = 2148, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 2148, score = 0.000
---
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would
S2: line = 2149, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 2149, score = 0.000
---
have this cat removed!'
S2: line = 2150, bytes = 23, words = 4
S3: line = 2150, score = 0.000
---
The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.
S2: line = 2152, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 2152, score = 0.226
---
'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round.
S2: line = 2153, bytes = 58, words = 10
S3: line = 2153, score = 0.000
---
'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he
S2: line = 2155, bytes = 66, words = 12
S3: line = 2155, score = 0.229
---
hurried off.
S2: line = 2156, bytes = 12, words = 2
S3: line = 2156, score = 0.000
---
Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
S2: line = 2158, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 2158, score = 0.000
---
on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with
S2: line = 2159, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 2159, score = 0.000
---
passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
S2: line = 2160, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 2160, score = 0.000
---
executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
S2: line = 2161, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 2161, score = 0.226
---
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
S2: line = 2162, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 2162, score = 0.000
---
whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.
S2: line = 2163, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 2163, score = 0.000
---
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
S2: line = 2165, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 2165, score = 0.229
---
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
S2: line = 2166, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 2166, score = 0.229
---
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the
S2: line = 2167, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 2167, score = 0.226
---
other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless
S2: line = 2168, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 2168, score = 0.000
---
sort of way to fly up into a tree.
S2: line = 2169, bytes = 34, words = 9
S3: line = 2169, score = 0.484
---
By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
S2: line = 2171, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 2171, score = 0.353
---
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't
S2: line = 2172, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 2172, score = 0.000
---
matter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side
S2: line = 2173, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 2173, score = 0.226
---
of the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
S2: line = 2174, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 2174, score = 0.000
---
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
S2: line = 2175, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 2175, score = 0.229
---
friend.
S2: line = 2176, bytes = 7, words = 1
S3: line = 2176, score = 0.308
---
When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a
S2: line = 2178, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 2178, score = 0.220
---
large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
S2: line = 2179, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 2179, score = 0.000
---
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
S2: line = 2180, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 2180, score = 0.000
---
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.
S2: line = 2181, bytes = 68, words = 11
S3: line = 2181, score = 0.000
---
The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
S2: line = 2183, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 2183, score = 0.000
---
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
S2: line = 2184, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 2184, score = 0.000
---
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
S2: line = 2185, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 2185, score = 0.223
---
what they said.
S2: line = 2186, bytes = 15, words = 3
S3: line = 2186, score = 0.000
---
The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless
S2: line = 2188, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 2188, score = 0.000
---
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
S2: line = 2189, bytes = 71, words = 18
S3: line = 2189, score = 0.212
---
thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.
S2: line = 2190, bytes = 63, words = 14
S3: line = 2190, score = 0.000
---
The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be
S2: line = 2192, bytes = 63, words = 13
S3: line = 2192, score = 0.000
---
beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.
S2: line = 2193, bytes = 48, words = 9
S3: line = 2193, score = 0.000
---
The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less
S2: line = 2195, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 2195, score = 0.000
---
than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last
S2: line = 2196, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 2196, score = 0.000
---
remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)
S2: line = 2197, bytes = 64, words = 12
S3: line = 2197, score = 0.000
---
Alice could think of nothing else to say but 'It belongs to the Duchess:
S2: line = 2199, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 2199, score = 0.000
---
you'd better ask HER about it.'
S2: line = 2200, bytes = 31, words = 7
S3: line = 2200, score = 0.000
---
'She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: 'fetch her here.'
S2: line = 2202, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 2202, score = 0.226
---
And the executioner went off like an arrow.
S2: line = 2203, bytes = 43, words = 8
S3: line = 2203, score = 0.000
---
 The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,
S2: line = 2205, bytes = 62, words = 13
S3: line = 2205, score = 0.226
---
by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely
S2: line = 2206, bytes = 62, words = 13
S3: line = 2206, score = 0.000
---
disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down
S2: line = 2207, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 2207, score = 0.229
---
looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.
S2: line = 2208, bytes = 66, words = 14
S3: line = 2208, score = 0.223

S2: line = 2215, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 2215, score = 0.000

said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and
S2: line = 2216, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 2216, score = 0.000
---

Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought

S3: line = 2219, score = 0.223

to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so

savage when they met in the kitchen.

S3: line = 2221, score = 0.000

'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone
S2: line = 2223, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 2223, score = 0.000

though), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very

S2: line = 2225, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 2225, score = 0.000

she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of

S3: line = 2226, score = 0.223

rule, 'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes

sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so

---
stingy about it, you know--'
S2: line = 2230, bytes = 28, words = 5
S3: line = 2230, score = 0.000
---
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
S2: line = 2232, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 2232, score = 0.226
---
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 'You're thinking
S2: line = 2233, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 2233, score = 0.000
---
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't

S3: line = 2234, score = 0.223

tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
S2: line = 2235, bytes = 71, words = 16

S2: line = 2236, bytes = 7, words = 2
S3: line = 2236, score = 0.000

'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.
S2: line = 2238, bytes = 50, words = 9
S3: line = 2238, score = 0.000
---
'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if only
S2: line = 2240, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 2240, score = 0.000
---
you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as
S2: line = 2241, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 2241, score = 0.220
---
she spoke.
S2: line = 2242, bytes = 10, words = 2
S3: line = 2242, score = 0.000
---
Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
S2: line = 2244, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 2244, score = 0.226
---
Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
S2: line = 2245, bytes = 64, words = 11
S3: line = 2245, score = 0.000
---
right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an
S2: line = 2246, bytes = 66, words = 14
S3: line = 2246, score = 0.000
---
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
S2: line = 2247, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 2247, score = 0.000

bore it as well as she could.
S2: line = 2248, bytes = 29, words = 7
S3: line = 2248, score = 0.000

'The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up
S2: line = 2250, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 2250, score = 0.220

the conversation a little.

''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis love,

sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, 'and the moral

'I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,'
S2: line = 2266, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 2266, score = 0.000

the Duchess said after a pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful about

the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?'

'HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to

have the experiment tried.

'Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite. And

the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock together."'

'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.

'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of

'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to

S3: line = 2283, score = 0.000

everything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. And

S3: line = 2288, score = 0.000

'it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.'

'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that

'I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very politely, 'if

S3: line = 2298, score = 0.433

'That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, in

feel a little worried.

S2: line = 2322, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 2322, score = 0.000

in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked

S3: line = 2323, score = 0.223

into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen
S2: line = 2324, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 2324, score = 0.000

in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.

'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.

S3: line = 2327, score = 0.226

'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the

The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

S3: line = 2333, score = 0.000

'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was
S2: line = 2335, bytes = 67, words = 15
S3: line = 2335, score = 0.000

too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the

The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were
S2: line = 2339, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 2339, score = 0.000

resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
S2: line = 2340, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 2340, score = 0.000

back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would
S2: line = 2341, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 2341, score = 0.000

cost them their lives.
S2: line = 2342, bytes = 22, words = 4
S3: line = 2342, score = 0.000

All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with
S2: line = 2344, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 2344, score = 0.000

the other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her

S3: line = 2346, score = 0.000

who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by

S3: line = 2347, score = 0.000

the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the

S3: line = 2348, score = 0.000

under sentence of execution.
S2: line = 2350, bytes = 28, words = 4
S3: line = 2350, score = 0.000

Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have

As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,

They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till

S2: line = 2392, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 2392, score = 0.000
---
Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his
S2: line = 2393, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 2393, score = 0.000
---
fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'
S2: line = 2394, bytes = 57, words = 12
S3: line = 2394, score = 0.229
---
So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
S2: line = 2396, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 2396, score = 0.000
---
full of tears, but said nothing.
S2: line = 2397, bytes = 32, words = 6
S3: line = 2397, score = 0.259
---
'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your

S3: line = 2399, score = 0.226

S2: line = 2400, bytes = 17, words = 3
S3: line = 2400, score = 0.000
---
'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit
S2: line = 2402, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 2402, score = 0.000

down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'
S2: line = 2403, bytes = 62, words = 14
S3: line = 2403, score = 0.445
---
So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
S2: line = 2405, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 2405, score = 0.452
---
herself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' But
S2: line = 2406, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 2406, score = 0.217
---
she waited patiently.
S2: line = 2407, bytes = 21, words = 3
S3: line = 2407, score = 0.000
---
'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real
S2: line = 2409, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 2409, score = 0.000
---
Turtle.'
S2: line = 2410, bytes = 8, words = 1
S3: line = 2410, score = 0.000
---
These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
S2: line = 2412, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 2412, score = 0.452
---
occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant
S2: line = 2413, bytes = 71, words = 10
S3: line = 2413, score = 0.238
---
heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
S2: line = 2414, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 2414, score = 0.000
---
saying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could
S2: line = 2415, bytes = 67, words = 11
S3: line = 2415, score = 0.233
---
not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said
S2: line = 2416, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 2416, score = 0.000
---
nothing.
S2: line = 2417, bytes = 8, words = 1
S3: line = 2417, score = 0.000
---
'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
S2: line = 2419, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 2419, score = 0.000
---
though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the

sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--'
S2: line = 2421, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 2421, score = 0.000
---
'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.
S2: line = 2423, bytes = 63, words = 13
S3: line = 2423, score = 0.000
---
'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle
S2: line = 2425, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 2425, score = 0.000
---
angrily: 'really you are very dull!'
S2: line = 2426, bytes = 36, words = 6
S3: line = 2426, score = 0.000
---
'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,'
S2: line = 2428, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 2428, score = 0.226
---
added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
S2: line = 2429, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 2429, score = 0.000
---
Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said
S2: line = 2430, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 2430, score = 0.223
---
to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!'
S2: line = 2431, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 2431, score = 0.220
---
and he went on in these words:
S2: line = 2432, bytes = 30, words = 7
S3: line = 2432, score = 0.000
---
'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--'
S2: line = 2434, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 2434, score = 0.000
---
'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.
S2: line = 2436, bytes = 43, words = 8
S3: line = 2436, score = 0.000
---
'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.
S2: line = 2438, bytes = 32, words = 6
S3: line = 2438, score = 0.000
---
'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
S2: line = 2440, bytes = 70, words = 11
S3: line = 2440, score = 0.000
---
The Mock Turtle went on.
S2: line = 2441, bytes = 24, words = 5
S3: line = 2441, score = 0.000
---
'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--'
S2: line = 2443, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 2443, score = 0.223
---
'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud
S2: line = 2445, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 2445, score = 0.000

S2: line = 2446, bytes = 13, words = 3
S3: line = 2446, score = 0.000

'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
S2: line = 2448, bytes = 56, words = 9
S3: line = 2448, score = 0.000
---
'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.'
S2: line = 2450, bytes = 49, words = 8
S3: line = 2450, score = 0.247
---
'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.
S2: line = 2452, bytes = 36, words = 6
S3: line = 2452, score = 0.000
---
'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.
S2: line = 2454, bytes = 40, words = 5
S3: line = 2454, score = 0.000
---
'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in
S2: line = 2456, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 2456, score = 0.000
---
a tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,
S2: line = 2457, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 2457, score = 0.000

"French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'
S2: line = 2458, bytes = 37, words = 5
S3: line = 2458, score = 0.266

'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of

S3: line = 2461, score = 0.000

'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 'I

only took the regular course.'
S2: line = 2464, bytes = 30, words = 5
S3: line = 2464, score = 0.000

'What was that?' inquired Alice.
S2: line = 2466, bytes = 32, words = 5
S3: line = 2466, score = 0.000
---
'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle
S2: line = 2468, bytes = 65, words = 11
S3: line = 2468, score = 0.000

replied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,

S2: line = 2470, bytes = 41, words = 4
S3: line = 2470, score = 0.000

'I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?'
S2: line = 2472, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 2472, score = 0.000
---
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 'What! Never heard of
S2: line = 2474, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 2474, score = 0.000

S2: line = 2475, bytes = 68, words = 11
S3: line = 2475, score = 0.000

'Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'
S2: line = 2477, bytes = 71, words = 10
S3: line = 2477, score = 0.000
---
'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is,
S2: line = 2479, bytes = 72, words = 15

S2: line = 2480, bytes = 21, words = 4
S3: line = 2480, score = 0.000

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she
S2: line = 2482, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 2482, score = 0.223
---
turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?'
S2: line = 2483, bytes = 65, words = 13
S3: line = 2483, score = 0.000
---
'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off

the subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, with

creatures hid their faces in their paws.

'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to

change the subject.
S2: line = 2506, bytes = 19, words = 3
S3: line = 2506, score = 0.000

'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so

'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.
S2: line = 2511, bytes = 39, words = 6
S3: line = 2511, score = 0.000

'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked:
S2: line = 2513, bytes = 65, words = 11
S3: line = 2513, score = 0.000

'because they lessen from day to day.'
S2: line = 2514, bytes = 38, words = 7
S3: line = 2514, score = 0.253

This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
S2: line = 2516, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 2516, score = 0.000

before she made her next remark. 'Then the eleventh day must have been a

then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their

 "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be

 But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance--

S3: line = 2608, score = 0.358

 Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.

S3: line = 2641, score = 0.000

'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they WOULD go with the lobsters

'I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the Gryphon. 'Do you

'I never thought about it,' said Alice. 'Why?'

'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly.
S2: line = 2656, bytes = 65, words = 11
S3: line = 2656, score = 0.000

Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated
S2: line = 2658, bytes = 70, words = 11

in a wondering tone.

S3: line = 2659, score = 0.000

'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. 'I mean, what

makes them so shiny?'

Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her

answer. 'They're done with blacking, I believe.'

'Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,

'are done with a whiting. Now you know.'

'And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.
S2: line = 2670, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 2670, score = 0.000

'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:

S3: line = 2675, score = 0.000

on the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep back, please: we

'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to ME, and

'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
S2: line = 2689, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 2689, score = 0.000

the Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures.'

S3: line = 2690, score = 0.000

'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' said

S3: line = 2692, score = 0.233

Alice a little timidly: 'but it's no use going back to yesterday,

S3: line = 2696, score = 0.000

'No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:

'explanations take such a dreadful time.'

So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
S2: line = 2701, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 2701, score = 0.358

saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
S2: line = 2702, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 2702, score = 0.223

the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened

their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went
S2: line = 2704, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 2704, score = 0.000

on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
S2: line = 2705, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 2705, score = 0.000

her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the

S3: line = 2706, score = 0.229

words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,
S2: line = 2707, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 2707, score = 0.226

and said 'That's very curious.'

'It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.

'It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. 'I

'What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle

interrupted, 'if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most

'Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and Alice was
S2: line = 2778, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 2778, score = 0.000

only too glad to do so.

on. 'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'

'Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,' Alice

replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
S2: line = 2789, bytes = 69, words = 12

'Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun

to repeat it, when a cry of 'The trial's beginning!' was heard in the

off, without waiting for the end of the song.
S2: line = 2817, bytes = 45, words = 9
S3: line = 2817, score = 0.242

'What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
S2: line = 2819, bytes = 65, words = 13
S3: line = 2819, score = 0.000

answered 'Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more faintly

came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--

CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts?

The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they
S2: line = 2831, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 2831, score = 0.000
---
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little
S2: line = 2832, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 2832, score = 0.000
---
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was
S2: line = 2833, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 2833, score = 0.000
---
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
S2: line = 2834, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 2834, score = 0.000
---
him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,
S2: line = 2835, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 2835, score = 0.000
---
and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court
S2: line = 2836, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 2836, score = 0.000
---
was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,
S2: line = 2837, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 2837, score = 0.000
---
that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the
S2: line = 2838, bytes = 71, words = 16
S3: line = 2838, score = 0.000
---
trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there
S2: line = 2839, bytes = 70, words = 11
S3: line = 2839, score = 0.000
---
seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about
S2: line = 2840, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 2840, score = 0.000
---
her, to pass away the time.
S2: line = 2841, bytes = 27, words = 6
S3: line = 2841, score = 0.000
---
Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
S2: line = 2843, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 2843, score = 0.000
---
about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
S2: line = 2844, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 2844, score = 0.223
---
the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to
S2: line = 2845, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 2845, score = 0.000
---
herself, 'because of his great wig.'
S2: line = 2846, bytes = 36, words = 6
S3: line = 2846, score = 0.000
---
The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the
S2: line = 2848, bytes = 70, words = 16
S3: line = 2848, score = 0.217
---
wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did
S2: line = 2849, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 2849, score = 0.217

not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.
S2: line = 2850, bytes = 63, words = 11
S3: line = 2850, score = 0.000

'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'
S2: line = 2852, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 2852, score = 0.000
---
(she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were
S2: line = 2853, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 2853, score = 0.000
---
animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said
S2: line = 2854, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 2854, score = 0.000
---
this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of
S2: line = 2855, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 2855, score = 0.000
---
it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her
S2: line = 2856, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 2856, score = 0.353
---
age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done
S2: line = 2857, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 2857, score = 0.000

just as well.
S2: line = 2858, bytes = 13, words = 3
S3: line = 2858, score = 0.000

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they
S2: line = 2860, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 2860, score = 0.000
---
doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put

S3: line = 2861, score = 0.000

down yet, before the trial's begun.'
S2: line = 2862, bytes = 36, words = 7
S3: line = 2862, score = 0.253
---
'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for
S2: line = 2864, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 2864, score = 0.459

fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'
S2: line = 2865, bytes = 58, words = 11
S3: line = 2865, score = 0.370

'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped
S2: line = 2867, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 2867, score = 0.000
---
hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the
S2: line = 2868, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 2868, score = 0.226
---
King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who
S2: line = 2869, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 2869, score = 0.000
---
was talking.
S2: line = 2870, bytes = 12, words = 2
S3: line = 2870, score = 0.000
---
Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
S2: line = 2872, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 2872, score = 0.000
---
that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,
S2: line = 2873, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 2873, score = 0.229
---
and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell
S2: line = 2874, bytes = 69, words = 16
S3: line = 2874, score = 0.000
---
'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice
S2: line = 2875, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 2875, score = 0.000

muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.
S2: line = 2876, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 2876, score = 0.000
---
One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice
S2: line = 2878, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 2878, score = 0.000
---
could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
S2: line = 2879, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 2879, score = 0.000
---
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly
S2: line = 2880, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 2880, score = 0.223
---
that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out
S2: line = 2881, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 2881, score = 0.000
---
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was
S2: line = 2882, bytes = 72, words = 16
S3: line = 2882, score = 0.217
---
obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was
S2: line = 2883, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 2883, score = 0.348
---
of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.
S2: line = 2884, bytes = 52, words = 12
S3: line = 2884, score = 0.000
---
'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.
S2: line = 2886, bytes = 45, words = 7
S3: line = 2886, score = 0.000
---
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
S2: line = 2888, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 2888, score = 0.000
---
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--
S2: line = 2889, bytes = 53, words = 8
S3: line = 2889, score = 0.247
---
   'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,

S3: line = 2892, score = 0.000

    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
S2: line = 2893, bytes = 46, words = 8
S3: line = 2893, score = 0.000

      And took them quite away!'

S3: line = 2894, score = 0.000

'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.
S2: line = 2896, bytes = 51, words = 9
S3: line = 2896, score = 0.000
---
'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great

deal to come before that!'
S2: line = 2899, bytes = 26, words = 5
S3: line = 2899, score = 0.000
---
'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three
S2: line = 2901, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 2901, score = 0.226
---
blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'
S2: line = 2902, bytes = 55, words = 9
S3: line = 2902, score = 0.242
---
The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one
S2: line = 2904, bytes = 65, words = 14
S3: line = 2904, score = 0.223
---
hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your

S3: line = 2905, score = 0.000

Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished
S2: line = 2906, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 2906, score = 0.358

my tea when I was sent for.'
S2: line = 2907, bytes = 28, words = 7
S3: line = 2907, score = 0.253
---
'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'
S2: line = 2909, bytes = 66, words = 12
S3: line = 2909, score = 0.229
---
The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
S2: line = 2911, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 2911, score = 0.226
---
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it
S2: line = 2912, bytes = 69, words = 13

was,' he said.
S2: line = 2913, bytes = 14, words = 3
S3: line = 2913, score = 0.000
---
'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.
S2: line = 2915, bytes = 33, words = 5
S3: line = 2915, score = 0.266
---
'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.
S2: line = 2917, bytes = 32, words = 4
S3: line = 2917, score = 0.000
---
'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
S2: line = 2919, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 2919, score = 0.226
---
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
S2: line = 2920, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 2920, score = 0.223
---
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
S2: line = 2921, bytes = 42, words = 7
S3: line = 2921, score = 0.000
---
'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.
S2: line = 2923, bytes = 49, words = 10
S3: line = 2923, score = 0.000
---
'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.
S2: line = 2925, bytes = 33, words = 7
S3: line = 2925, score = 0.000
---
'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a
S2: line = 2927, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 2927, score = 0.000
---
memorandum of the fact.
S2: line = 2928, bytes = 23, words = 4
S3: line = 2928, score = 0.274
---
'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of
S2: line = 2930, bytes = 72, words = 15

my own. I'm a hatter.'
S2: line = 2931, bytes = 22, words = 6
S3: line = 2931, score = 0.000
---
Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
S2: line = 2933, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 2933, score = 0.000
---
who turned pale and fidgeted.
S2: line = 2934, bytes = 29, words = 5
S3: line = 2934, score = 0.266

'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have
S2: line = 2936, bytes = 72, words = 15

you executed on the spot.'
S2: line = 2937, bytes = 26, words = 5
S3: line = 2937, score = 0.000

This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
S2: line = 2939, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 2939, score = 0.000
---
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in

S3: line = 2940, score = 0.358

his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
S2: line = 2941, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 2941, score = 0.000

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
S2: line = 2944, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 2944, score = 0.229
---
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
S2: line = 2945, bytes = 68, words = 15
S3: line = 2945, score = 0.000
---
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
S2: line = 2946, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 2946, score = 0.223
---
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
S2: line = 2947, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 2947, score = 0.000
---
long as there was room for her.
S2: line = 2948, bytes = 31, words = 7
S3: line = 2948, score = 0.506
---
'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting
S2: line = 2950, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 2950, score = 0.000
---
next to her. 'I can hardly breathe.'
S2: line = 2951, bytes = 36, words = 7
S3: line = 2951, score = 0.000
---
'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'
S2: line = 2953, bytes = 57, words = 12
S3: line = 2953, score = 0.000
---
'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.
S2: line = 2955, bytes = 50, words = 10
S3: line = 2955, score = 0.000
---
'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing
S2: line = 2957, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 2957, score = 0.000

too.'
S2: line = 2958, bytes = 5, words = 1
S3: line = 2958, score = 0.000
---
'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that
S2: line = 2960, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 2960, score = 0.000
---
ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the
S2: line = 2961, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 2961, score = 0.226
---
other side of the court.
S2: line = 2962, bytes = 24, words = 5
S3: line = 2962, score = 0.000
---
All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
S2: line = 2964, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 2964, score = 0.000
---
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
S2: line = 2965, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 2965, score = 0.000
---
of the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on
S2: line = 2966, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 2966, score = 0.000
---
which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.
S2: line = 2967, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 2967, score = 0.000
---
'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you
S2: line = 2969, bytes = 66, words = 12
S3: line = 2969, score = 0.000
---
executed, whether you're nervous or not.'
S2: line = 2970, bytes = 41, words = 7
S3: line = 2970, score = 0.000
---
'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
S2: line = 2972, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 2972, score = 0.000
---
'--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the
S2: line = 2973, bytes = 71, words = 17
S3: line = 2973, score = 0.000
---
bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'
S2: line = 2974, bytes = 65, words = 12
S3: line = 2974, score = 0.000
---
'The twinkling of the what?' said the King.
S2: line = 2976, bytes = 43, words = 8
S3: line = 2976, score = 0.000
---
'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.
S2: line = 2978, bytes = 44, words = 8
S3: line = 2978, score = 0.000
---
'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do you
S2: line = 2980, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 2980, score = 0.000
---
take me for a dunce? Go on!'
S2: line = 2981, bytes = 28, words = 7
S3: line = 2981, score = 0.253
---
'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after
S2: line = 2983, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 2983, score = 0.000

that--only the March Hare said--'
S2: line = 2984, bytes = 33, words = 6
S3: line = 2984, score = 0.000

'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.
S2: line = 2986, bytes = 56, words = 11
S3: line = 2986, score = 0.000
---
'You did!' said the Hatter.
S2: line = 2988, bytes = 27, words = 5
S3: line = 2988, score = 0.000
---
'I deny it!' said the March Hare.
S2: line = 2990, bytes = 33, words = 7
S3: line = 2990, score = 0.000

'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'
S2: line = 2992, bytes = 53, words = 10
S3: line = 2992, score = 0.000
---
'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking
S2: line = 2994, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 2994, score = 0.000
---
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
S2: line = 2995, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 2995, score = 0.000
---
nothing, being fast asleep.
S2: line = 2996, bytes = 27, words = 4
S3: line = 2996, score = 0.274
---
'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'
S2: line = 2998, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 2998, score = 0.000
---
'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.
S2: line = 3000, bytes = 55, words = 11
S3: line = 3000, score = 0.000
---
'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.
S2: line = 3002, bytes = 41, words = 8
S3: line = 3002, score = 0.000
---
'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'
S2: line = 3004, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 3004, score = 0.000
---
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
S2: line = 3006, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 3006, score = 0.000
---
down on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.
S2: line = 3007, bytes = 59, words = 13
S3: line = 3007, score = 0.226
---
'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.
S2: line = 3009, bytes = 44, words = 9
S3: line = 3009, score = 0.000
---
Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
S2: line = 3011, bytes = 70, words = 12
S3: line = 3011, score = 0.000
---
the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
S2: line = 3012, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 3012, score = 0.000
---
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
S2: line = 3013, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 3013, score = 0.000
---
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
S2: line = 3014, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 3014, score = 0.000
---
head first, and then sat upon it.)
S2: line = 3015, bytes = 34, words = 7
S3: line = 3015, score = 0.253
---
'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read
S2: line = 3017, bytes = 66, words = 15
S3: line = 3017, score = 0.000

in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some attempts

court," and I never understood what it meant till now.'
S2: line = 3020, bytes = 55, words = 10
S3: line = 3020, score = 0.000

'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the
S2: line = 3022, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 3022, score = 0.223

King.
S2: line = 3023, bytes = 5, words = 1
S3: line = 3023, score = 0.000

'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the floor, as it is.'
S2: line = 3025, bytes = 69, words = 17
S3: line = 3025, score = 0.214
---
'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.
S2: line = 3027, bytes = 42, words = 8
S3: line = 3027, score = 0.247
---
Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
S2: line = 3029, bytes = 54, words = 9
S3: line = 3029, score = 0.000
---
'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall get
S2: line = 3031, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 3031, score = 0.229

on better.'
S2: line = 3032, bytes = 11, words = 2
S3: line = 3032, score = 0.000
---
'I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the
S2: line = 3034, bytes = 72, words = 15
S3: line = 3034, score = 0.220

Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
S2: line = 3035, bytes = 43, words = 8
S3: line = 3035, score = 0.000
---
'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
S2: line = 3037, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 3037, score = 0.000
---
without even waiting to put his shoes on.
S2: line = 3038, bytes = 41, words = 8
S3: line = 3038, score = 0.000
---
'--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the
S2: line = 3040, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 3040, score = 0.000
---
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
S2: line = 3041, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 3041, score = 0.000
---
to the door.
S2: line = 3042, bytes = 12, words = 3
S3: line = 3042, score = 0.000
---
'Call the next witness!' said the King.
S2: line = 3044, bytes = 39, words = 7
S3: line = 3044, score = 0.000
---
The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in
S2: line = 3046, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 3046, score = 0.000
---
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
S2: line = 3047, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 3047, score = 0.000
---
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
S2: line = 3048, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 3048, score = 0.223
---
'Give your evidence,' said the King.
S2: line = 3050, bytes = 36, words = 6
S3: line = 3050, score = 0.000
---
'Shan't,' said the cook.
S2: line = 3052, bytes = 24, words = 5
S3: line = 3052, score = 0.000
---
The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
S2: line = 3054, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 3054, score = 0.000
---
'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'
S2: line = 3055, bytes = 47, words = 7
S3: line = 3055, score = 0.000
---
'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
S2: line = 3057, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 3057, score = 0.000
---
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
S2: line = 3058, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 3058, score = 0.358
---
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?'
S2: line = 3059, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 3059, score = 0.000
---
'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.
S2: line = 3061, bytes = 32, words = 5
S3: line = 3061, score = 0.000
---
'Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.
S2: line = 3063, bytes = 42, words = 7
S3: line = 3063, score = 0.000
---
'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. 'Behead that Dormouse!
S2: line = 3065, bytes = 70, words = 10
S3: line = 3065, score = 0.000

Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
S2: line = 3066, bytes = 70, words = 13

S2: line = 3067, bytes = 10, words = 1
S3: line = 3067, score = 0.000
---
For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
S2: line = 3069, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 3069, score = 0.229
---
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
S2: line = 3070, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 3070, score = 0.223
---
disappeared.
S2: line = 3071, bytes = 12, words = 1
S3: line = 3071, score = 0.000
---
'Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief. 'Call the next
S2: line = 3073, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 3073, score = 0.000
---
witness.' And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear,
S2: line = 3074, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 3074, score = 0.000
---
YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead
S2: line = 3075, bytes = 67, words = 12

ache!'
S2: line = 3076, bytes = 6, words = 1
S3: line = 3076, score = 0.000
---
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very
S2: line = 3078, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 3078, score = 0.358
---
curious to see what the next witness would be like, '--for they haven't
S2: line = 3079, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 3079, score = 0.223
---
got much evidence YET,' she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when
S2: line = 3080, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 3080, score = 0.000
---
the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the

S3: line = 3087, score = 0.000

'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
S2: line = 3090, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 3090, score = 0.364
---
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
S2: line = 3091, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 3091, score = 0.220
---
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
S2: line = 3092, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 3092, score = 0.000
---
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
S2: line = 3093, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 3093, score = 0.000
---
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish
S2: line = 3094, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 3094, score = 0.000
---
she had accidentally upset the week before.
S2: line = 3095, bytes = 43, words = 7
S3: line = 3095, score = 0.000
---
'Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
S2: line = 3097, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 3097, score = 0.000
---
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of
S2: line = 3098, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 3098, score = 0.223
---
the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea
S2: line = 3099, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 3099, score = 0.000
---
that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or
S2: line = 3100, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 3100, score = 0.000
---
they would die.
S2: line = 3101, bytes = 15, words = 3
S3: line = 3101, score = 0.000
---
'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until
S2: line = 3103, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 3103, score = 0.000
---
all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,' he repeated with
S2: line = 3104, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 3104, score = 0.000

great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.
S2: line = 3105, bytes = 52, words = 10
S3: line = 3105, score = 0.000
---
Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
S2: line = 3107, bytes = 69, words = 15
S3: line = 3107, score = 0.000
---
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
S2: line = 3108, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 3108, score = 0.226

tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got
S2: line = 3109, bytes = 72, words = 14
S3: line = 3109, score = 0.223
---
it out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said
S2: line = 3110, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 3110, score = 0.000
---
to herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial
S2: line = 3111, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 3111, score = 0.000

one way up as the other.'
S2: line = 3112, bytes = 25, words = 6
S3: line = 3112, score = 0.259

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
S2: line = 3114, bytes = 66, words = 14
S3: line = 3114, score = 0.223
---
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
S2: line = 3115, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 3115, score = 0.226
---
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the

S3: line = 3116, score = 0.000

accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do

S3: line = 3117, score = 0.000

anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the

court.

'Nothing,' said Alice.
S2: line = 3123, bytes = 22, words = 3

'Nothing whatever,' said Alice.
S2: line = 3127, bytes = 31, words = 4
S3: line = 3127, score = 0.000

'That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury. They were
S2: line = 3129, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 3129, score = 0.000
---
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit
S2: line = 3130, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 3130, score = 0.226

interrupted: 'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a

S2: line = 3132, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 3132, score = 0.358

'UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on
S2: line = 3134, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 3134, score = 0.000
---
to himself in an undertone,
S2: line = 3135, bytes = 27, words = 5
S3: line = 3135, score = 0.000
---
'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as if he were trying
S2: line = 3137, bytes = 71, words = 9
S3: line = 3137, score = 0.000

which word sounded best.
S2: line = 3138, bytes = 24, words = 4
S3: line = 3138, score = 0.000

Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.'
S2: line = 3140, bytes = 67, words = 11
S3: line = 3140, score = 0.233

Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
S2: line = 3141, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 3141, score = 0.000
---
'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself.
S2: line = 3142, bytes = 54, words = 11
S3: line = 3142, score = 0.000
---
At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in
S2: line = 3144, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 3144, score = 0.223
---
his note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'Rule

S2: line = 3146, bytes = 65, words = 13

Everybody looked at Alice.
S2: line = 3148, bytes = 26, words = 4

'I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.

'You are,' said the King.

'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.

'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not a

'It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.

'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.
S2: line = 3161, bytes = 45, words = 9
S3: line = 3161, score = 0.000

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider your

S3: line = 3164, score = 0.000

'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the White

'What's in it?' said the Queen.

S3: line = 3170, score = 0.000
---
'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be a

S2: line = 3173, bytes = 49, words = 8
S3: line = 3173, score = 0.000

'It must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was written to

S2: line = 3176, bytes = 37, words = 7
S3: line = 3176, score = 0.000

'Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.
S2: line = 3178, bytes = 49, words = 10
S3: line = 3178, score = 0.000
---
'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's
S2: line = 3180, bytes = 68, words = 14

S2: line = 3181, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 3181, score = 0.000

added 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'

S3: line = 3182, score = 0.000

'Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of the jurymen.
S2: line = 3184, bytes = 71, words = 12
S3: line = 3184, score = 0.000
---
'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thing
S2: line = 3186, bytes = 72, words = 14

about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)
S2: line = 3187, bytes = 41, words = 7
S3: line = 3187, score = 0.000
---
'He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King. (The jury
S2: line = 3189, bytes = 70, words = 13
S3: line = 3189, score = 0.000

all brightened up again.)
S2: line = 3190, bytes = 25, words = 4
S3: line = 3190, score = 0.000

'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I didn't write it, and they

S3: line = 3193, score = 0.000

'If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that only makes the matter

S2: line = 3197, bytes = 25, words = 5
S3: line = 3197, score = 0.000

There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
S2: line = 3199, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 3199, score = 0.223

'That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.

S3: line = 3202, score = 0.000
---
'It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. 'Why, you don't even know

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please

'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till you

These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--

   'They told me you had been to her,

   She gave me a good character,

   If she should push the matter on,

   I gave her one, they gave him two,

S3: line = 3227, score = 0.000

    You gave us three or more;
S2: line = 3228, bytes = 30, words = 6
S3: line = 3228, score = 0.000

   They all returned from him to you,

sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures
S2: line = 3318, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 3318, score = 0.000

of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had
S2: line = 3319, bytes = 63, words = 13
S3: line = 3319, score = 0.000
---
finished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It WAS a curious dream,

S3: line = 3320, score = 0.229
---
dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.' So
S2: line = 3321, bytes = 67, words = 14
S3: line = 3321, score = 0.000
---
Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
S2: line = 3322, bytes = 68, words = 14
S3: line = 3322, score = 0.000
---
what a wonderful dream it had been.
S2: line = 3323, bytes = 35, words = 7
S3: line = 3323, score = 0.000
---
But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
S2: line = 3325, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 3325, score = 0.000
---
hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her
S2: line = 3326, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 3326, score = 0.000
---
wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and
S2: line = 3327, bytes = 70, words = 11
S3: line = 3327, score = 0.233
---
this was her dream:--
S2: line = 3328, bytes = 21, words = 4
S3: line = 3328, score = 0.000
---
First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
S2: line = 3330, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 3330, score = 0.229
---
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking
S2: line = 3331, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 3331, score = 0.000
---
up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that
S2: line = 3332, bytes = 70, words = 15
S3: line = 3332, score = 0.000
---
queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
S2: line = 3333, bytes = 66, words = 13
S3: line = 3333, score = 0.000
---
WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to
S2: line = 3334, bytes = 71, words = 14
S3: line = 3334, score = 0.000
---
listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures
S2: line = 3335, bytes = 74, words = 12
S3: line = 3335, score = 0.000
---
of her little sister's dream.
S2: line = 3336, bytes = 29, words = 6
S3: line = 3336, score = 0.000

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the

S3: line = 3338, score = 0.445
---
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
S2: line = 3339, bytes = 68, words = 10
S3: line = 3339, score = 0.475
---
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
S2: line = 3340, bytes = 70, words = 14
S3: line = 3340, score = 0.223
---
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
S2: line = 3341, bytes = 65, words = 12
S3: line = 3341, score = 0.000
---
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
S2: line = 3342, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 3342, score = 0.000
---
was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed
S2: line = 3343, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 3343, score = 0.000
---
around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
S2: line = 3344, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 3344, score = 0.000
---
Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
S2: line = 3345, bytes = 69, words = 12
S3: line = 3345, score = 0.000
---
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock

---
Turtle.
S2: line = 3347, bytes = 7, words = 1
S3: line = 3347, score = 0.000

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
S2: line = 3349, bytes = 61, words = 12
S3: line = 3349, score = 0.000
---
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
S2: line = 3350, bytes = 67, words = 13
S3: line = 3350, score = 0.000
---
would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the
S2: line = 3351, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 3351, score = 0.000
---
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling
S2: line = 3352, bytes = 68, words = 13
S3: line = 3352, score = 0.000
---
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill
S2: line = 3353, bytes = 68, words = 12
S3: line = 3353, score = 0.000
---
cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the
S2: line = 3354, bytes = 71, words = 15
S3: line = 3354, score = 0.000
---
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she
S2: line = 3355, bytes = 72, words = 13
S3: line = 3355, score = 0.000
---
knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing
S2: line = 3356, bytes = 69, words = 13
S3: line = 3356, score = 0.226
---
of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's

heavy sobs.
S2: line = 3358, bytes = 11, words = 2
S3: line = 3358, score = 0.000

Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
S2: line = 3360, bytes = 67, words = 12
S3: line = 3360, score = 0.000

would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would

keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her

childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and
S2: line = 3363, bytes = 72, words = 12
S3: line = 3363, score = 0.000
---
make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even
S2: line = 3364, bytes = 71, words = 13
S3: line = 3364, score = 0.000
---
with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with
S2: line = 3365, bytes = 69, words = 14
S3: line = 3365, score = 0.445
---
all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
S2: line = 3366, bytes = 71, words = 13

remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
